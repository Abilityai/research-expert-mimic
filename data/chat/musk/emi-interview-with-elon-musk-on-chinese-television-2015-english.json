So I really like the fact that when people buy a car that they experience delight. And for many people, they’ve told me it’s like the best product they’ve ever bought, and it made them happy. And there was one person who said, like, whenever they feel sad, they can just go to the garage and look at the car, and it makes them happy. I was like, that’s cool. That’s really cool."

And so when I see the car, I see all the things that I think need to be fixed to make it better. And so it’s certainly easy to lose the sense of wonder or just see the flaws. But it’s a difficult thing to reconcile because if you want to make something better, then you must analyze it for the flaws. But then that kind of prevents the enjoyment of it. It’s a difficult dichotomy.\n(01:52 – 02:17)\nA documentary sequence about Elon Musk in Chinese, translation not available"

It’s better for the world from an environmental standpoint and from an economic standpoint if we transition to electric transport sooner. It will help with pollution and global warming and all that stuff. And I do think we’re headed towards an age of autonomous transport where you know, you just summon the car with your phone or something and then get in, and you just tell the computer where you want to go, and it takes you there. It’s gonna happen very quickly, I think maybe in four or five years."

But I do think it’s worth saying: ‘Okay, let’s take 1% and try to establish a self-sustaining city on Mars and make life multi-planetary.’ And I think there’s a couple of good reasons for that. First of all, there’s always the possibility that there could be some terrible thing that happens on Earth that we maybe don’t anticipate. If you look at the fossil record and the fact that there’ve been five major extinction events in the last 500 million years, and what happened to the dinosaurs. They used to be here; they’re not around anymore. So that’s kind of the defensive argument. And then there’s what I call maybe the inspiration argument, the excitement. Building a city on Mars would just be this incredible adventure, that there be things in life that are exciting and inspiring that when you wake up in the morning, you’re like, yes, I’m glad to be alive. And I think having this great adventure would be like that."

Because at that point, even though the fourth launch of SpaceX had succeeded, we were still running out of money because we had three failures and only one success – still not enough. And then the financing round for Tesla had not closed, and we had only two days, maybe three… I think it was like two or three days maybe, to close it before Christmas.

That’s maybe a bit different from most other schools is that there aren’t any grades, there’s no like, grade one, grade two, grade three type of thing. And making all the children go in the same grade at the same time, like an assembly line. You know, because some people love English or languages, some people love math, some people love music, and they have different abilities at different times. It makes more sense to cater the education to match their aptitudes and abilities. Like, that’s one principle.\nAnother is that it’s important to teach problem-solving or teach to the problem, not to the tools. So this would be like, let’s say, you’re trying to teach people about how engines work. A more traditional approach would be to say, we’re going to teach you all about screwdrivers and wrenches, and you’re gonna have a course on screwdrivers, a course on wrenches and all these things. That’s a very difficult way to do it. A much better way would be like, here’s the engine. Now let’s take it apart. How we’re going to take it apart? Oh, you need a screwdriver. That’s what the screwdriver is for. You need a wrench? That’s what the wrench is for. And then the very important thing happens, which is that the relevance of the tools becomes apparent."

Like, you know, those two principals, they weren’t adhering to those principles. So I thought, well, let’s see what we can do. Maybe creating a school will be better. And actually, I hired a teacher from the school they were at, who also agreed with me that there was a better way to do it."

You start off with an idea, and that idea is mostly wrong. And then you adapt that idea and keep refining it. And you listen to criticism. Some criticism you discard – you try to discard the wrong criticism – try to listen to the correct criticism, and then engage in sort of recursive self-improvement, in constantly refining it and making it better.\nAnd you have to work super hard – that’s very important. And then just keep iterating on a loop, which says, am I doing something useful for other people? Because that’s what a company is supposed to do. You know, a company is just a group of people gathered together to produce a product or service. And a company should only exist if that product or service is truly useful to customers.\n(29:03 – 29:15)\nA documentary sequence about Elon Musk in Chinese, translation not available"

And, you know, key goal with Tesla is to be able to make an affordable, great electric car, a sort of third-generation car. Because you can only change the world for electric cars if people can afford to buy a great electric car. Affordable electric cars are not great, and the great electric cars are not affordable. We need great electric cars that are affordable. So that’s the goal with Tesla. And with SpaceX, it’s a bit of a longer-term goal because we need to make reusability work with rockets. That’s fundamental to improving the cost of spaceflight by a factor of 100. And then we need to make the rockets really big and be able to send large amounts of people and cargo to Mars. And right now, nobody’s been to Mars. So this is a very tall hill to climb."
