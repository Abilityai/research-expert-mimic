These human spaceflight missions were a beacon of hope to me and to millions over the past two years, as our world has been going through one of the most difficult periods in recent human history.

And we racked our brains to think of any possible way to improve the probability of success. We could not think of anything more, and nor could NASA. And so, that’s just the best that we could do. So then we went ahead and launched. Now, I’m not a religious person, but I nonetheless got on my knees and prayed for that mission."

I think it would be tragic, extremely tragic, if Apollo was the high watermark for humanity, and that’s as far as we ever got. It’s concerning that here we are 49 years after the last mission to the Moon – so almost half a century. And we’ve not been back. That’s worrying; it’s like, does that mean we’ve peaked as a civilization or what?\nSo I think we got to get back to the Moon and build a base there, a science base. I think we could learn a lot about the nature of the universe if we have a proper science base on the Moon. We have a science base in Antarctica and many other parts of the world. So that’s what I think the next big thing we’ve got to have like a serious Moonbase. And then get people to Mars and get out there and be a spacefaring civilization."

Or are you just so overwhelmed with all the challenges that you have to solve?\nAnd actually, sort of to add to that, the reason I want to ask this question of May 30\nth\n– it’s been some time, so you can look back and think about the impact already. At the time, it was an engineering problem maybe, now it’s becoming a historic moment. Like, it’s a moment that – how many moments will be remembered about the 21st century?

And still, I think an engine should only count if it has gotten something to orbit. So our engine has not gotten anything to orbit yet.

      "role": "elon_musk",
      "text": "Well, the Raptor is a full flow staged combustion engine, and it’s operating at a very high chamber pressure. So one of the key figures of merit, perhaps the key figure of merit is what is the chamber pressure at which the rocket engine operate. That’s the combustion chamber pressure. Raptor is designed to operate at 300 bar, possibly, maybe higher, that’s 300 atmospheres. So the record right now for operational engine is the RD-engine that I mentioned, the Russian RD, which is, I believe, around 267 bar.\nAnd the difficulty of the chamber pressure is it increases on a nonlinear basis. 10% more pressure is more like 50% more difficult. But that chamber pressure is… that is what allows you to get a very high power density for the engine, enabling a very high thrust to weight ratio, and a very high specific impulse. Specific impulse is like a measure of the efficiency of a rocket engine. It’s really the effect of exhaust velocity of the gas coming out of the engine. With a very high chamber pressure, you can have a compact engine that nonetheless has a high expansion ratio, which is the ratio between the exit nozzle and the throat. Rocket engines got like sort of an hourglass shape. It’s like a chamber, and then it necks down, and there’s a nozzle. And the ratio of the exit diameter to the throat is expansion ratio."

So basically, you’ve got propellants and hot gas flowing simultaneously to so many different places on the engine. And they all have a recursive effect on each other. So you change one thing here has a recursive effect here that changes something over there. It’s quite hard to control. There’s a reason why no one’s made this before. The reason we’re doing a stage combustion full flow is because it has the highest theoretical possible efficiency.\nSo in order to make a fully reusable rocket – that’s really the holy grail of orbital rocketry – everything’s got to be the best. It’s got to be the best engine, the best airframe, the best heat shield, extremely light avionics, very clever control mechanisms. You’ve got to shed mass in any possible way that you can. For example, instead of putting landing legs on the booster and ship, we are going to catch them with a tower to save the weight of the landing legs. I mean, we’re talking about catching the largest flying object ever made on a giant tower with chopstick arms. It’s like “Karate Kid” with the fly, but much bigger.

It’s really just saying let’s boil something down to the most fundamental principles, the things that we are most confident are true at a foundational level, and that sets your axiomatic base, and then you reason up from there. And then you cross-check your conclusion against the axiomatic truth. Some basics in physics would be like, are you violating conservation of energy or momentum or something like that? Then it’s not going to work. That’s just to establish, is it possible? Another good physics tool is thinking about things in the limit.

And that sets the asymptotic limit for how low the cost of the vehicle can be unless you change the materials.\nAnd then when you do that – I call it like, maybe the magic wand number or something like that – that would be like, if you had just a pile of these raw materials here and you could wave a magic wand and rearrange the atoms into the final shape, that would be the lowest possible cost that you could make this thing for unless you change the materials.

And then Jim kind of schooled me on saying like, okay, like this kind of first principles thinking of how can we get the cost of manufacturing down.

I mean, Starship is the most complex and advanced rocket that’s ever been made by, I don’t know, an order of magnitude or something like that. It’s a lot. It’s really next level. And the fundamental optimization of Starship is minimizing cost per ton to orbit and ultimately cost per ton to the surface of Mars. This may seem like a mercantile objective, but it is actually the thing that needs to be optimized. There is a certain cost per tonne to the surface of Mars where we can afford to establish a self-sustaining city. And then, above that, we cannot afford to do it. Right now, you couldn’t fly to Mars for a trillion dollars; no amount of money could get you a ticket to Mars. So we need to get that like something that is actually possible at all. We don’t want to just want to have with Mars flags and footprints and then not come back for a half century like we did with the Moon.\nIn order to pass a very important “great filter”, I think we need to be a multi-planet species. This may sound somewhat esoteric to a lot of people, but eventually, given enough time, there’s something… Earth is likely to experience some calamity. That could be something that humans do to themselves or an external event like what happened to the dinosaurs. And if none of that happens, and somehow magically, we keep going, then the sun will… the sun is gradually expanding and will engulf the Earth. And probably Earth gets too hot for life in about 500 million years. It’s a long time, but that’s only 10% longer than Earth has been around.\nThe current situation is really remarkable and kind of hard to believe, but Earth has been around four and a half billion years, and this is the first time in four and a half billion years that it’s been possible to extend life beyond Earth. And that window of opportunity may be open for a long time, and I hope it is, but it also may be open for a short time. And I think it is wise for us to act quickly, while the window is open, just in case it closes."

But if it’s World War III, it’s more of a bang. But these are all risks. I mean, it’s important to think of these things and just think of things like probabilities, not certainties. There’s a certain probability that something bad will happen on Earth. I think most likely the future will be good. But there’s like, let’s say for argument’s sake, a 1% chance per century of a civilization-ending event. That was Stephen Hawking’s estimate. I think he might be right about that. We should basically think of us being a multi-planet species. It’s like taking out insurance for life itself – like life insurance for life.\n(both laughing)"
