But production is hard, especially if you have advanced production techniques that people have not used before.  The vast majority of our engineering effort is in manufacturing, basically designing the machine that makes the machine. So, I can’t emphasize this enough. The factory, especially an advanced factory, is the hard part; the vehicle design is comparatively easy.\nSo, we will aim for half a million vehicles a year. That is our goal to get there as quickly as possible. The only limitation on growth is how quickly we can make cars that are high quality, high reliability. That’s the only governing element on the rate of progress. But nonetheless, even with extreme effort, I think it probably takes us until – this is just a guess – until roughly the end of 22 to reach that level of production."

If you have a compelling product, and it is affordable, so the value for money is good – you know, people can have enough money to buy it – and the product itself is compelling, then demand is never going to be an issue. So that is not something I worry about. I do worry about making sure that we can achieve affordability thresholds.\nBecause even if you make the value for money infinite, if people did not have enough money to buy it, they still can’t. Then it’s just frustrating for people. They see this great product, too expensive, can’t buy it.

Physics is fundamentally just understanding how does the universe actually work. And then that’s a good foundation for a variety of engineering disciplines. And I think, also, the analytical principles, the sort of analytical constructs used in physics, apply to basically anything.\nIt’s, you know, physics developed all these ways of thinking, like, first principles thinking, thinking about things in the limit of high and low. You’re testing your hypothesis – the scientific principle, essentially. These things are incredibly helpful in all arenas. It’s just, most people tend to think by analogy or by comparison with something that already exists. And this is a sort of mental shortcut that requires less brain strain, but it does not… – It’s hard to get fundamental insights unless you think about things from a first principle standpoint."

It’s just sort of…- cogent thinking would be another way to refer to it.\nSay, like, are these axioms believed to be the most believed to be true? Are they the most relevant?

You know, it’s not like a place you get email or post pictures or something. Really, the internet is like a nervous system for humanity, whereas previously, communication was more like osmosis. In order for information to travel, somebody would have to call someone with a phone or write them a letter, and then that letter would be carried by another person, by a series of people to the destination.\nNow, communication can happen instantly from any place in the world to any anyone else and does not need a human to carry it. This is sort of like, at a cellular level, you see, say a small primitive multicellular creature will just communicate by osmosis from one cell to the next, or diffusion, essentially. But once you have a more sophisticated organism, you have a nervous system. The speed at which information can travel is much faster. And the accessibility of information is fundamentally different.\nAnd now, with the internet, you could be, you know, in the middle of Amazon jungle with the internet with a satellite connection, and you have access to all the world’s information. Whereas previously, even if you lived in the\nLibrary of Congress\nin the US where the most books are, you still would only have access to a fraction of the world’s information. This is basically humanity becoming a superorganism to a degree that’s not possible unless you have sort of essentially instant lightspeed communication from anywhere to anywhere, as opposed to osmosis, diffusion."

And I once heard you’re saying that connected cars, autonomous driving, ‘What infrastructure do you need?’ And you answered I think it was like ‘We take what we get’, which is a bit disappointing for us because we have such great 4G, 5G, and want to hear that it needs to be connected. What is your perspective on connectivity bandwidth you need for the car, for the future?\nAnd then another question to it.  How do you stay ahead? Because I think you were the first one to understand that electromobility could be big and will be big, and it’s the right way. It’s good efficiency. How do you stay ahead of the others?

So, if you in order to make a car drive properly, you have to solve vision. And at the point where you have solved vision, you really don’t need any other instruments. Like a careful driver, human driver, can drive with an extremely good track record. And unlike a human, the computer does not get tired. It has 360-degree surround cameras, it’s got three cameras pointing forward. So, it’s like being able to see with eyes in the back of your head, basically. It’s really, vision is the way to go.\nThere’s some value to active optical, for a wavelength that’s occlusion penetrating, so it can see through fog or rain or dust. But it has to be high resolution, such that you can rely on like, for example, for radar at roughly four millimeter wavelength. This is good for occlusion penetration.

But there’s two billion cars and trucks in active use, and that number is rising. Basically, it takes 20 years from the point of which 100% of all vehicle production is electric; it’s still 20 years from that point before the fleet is fully electric.\nSo, I think people sometimes… – you know it, of course – but most people don’t realize, it’s not like phones, you can’t just replace all the cars and trucks overnight. The new vehicle production is only 5% the size of the fleet. And as it is right now, only a few percent of new car production is electric.

Your vision, I think what I learned is also goes beyond electric cars. It considers the transition to renewable energy, which I find super inspiring, and the most important thing to me or to my kids. What do you think is needed?\nOn the one hand, do we look at the, let’s say, green energy options that we know today, like sun and wind? And is it decentralized? Or would you build such an inspiring plant, as we have seen today, in a place where there’s a lot of sun or wind? Or do you even look at totally new energy sources that go beyond that?"

Wind has actually been… – I’ve been surprised just how good wind has gotten. Wind power is extremely low cost. In fact, a lot of the best wind turbines are made in Germany. So, the numbers are extremely good.\nThat needs to be paired with large battery packs in order to buffer the wind power because the wind speed changes. And sometimes it doesn’t blow wind. But people want steady electricity; they don’t want to have just have electricity when the wind’s blowing. So, you have to pair wind turbines with large battery packs. And the same is with solar. You’ve got to buffer the solar panels. Obviously, it’s no sun at night, and sometimes it’s very cloudy."

So we, you know, it costs some money, nobody was using it, so we turned it off. We can easily turn it back on right now. And actually easy, especially in Europe, because of the way the connectors work. A little more, we need like a maybe $100 accessory to be able to do this in the US.\nBut I really think people want to have a home-based battery…- like, I think the future that I see most likely is solar on the roof. So, either where the roof itself, this roof tile itself, are solar generating or solar panels retrofit on an existing roof combined with a local battery, we have a product called the power wall, it’s very popular. And then you need to combine that with grid-level solar and wind. And then we have a long-distance high-voltage DC connection.\nHigh voltage DC is extremely efficient at transferring electric power. No need for superconductors, in my view. The energy penalty for long-distance electricity transmission is I²R, so it’s the current squared times resistance. If you just increase the voltage, you can have the current be low , and then your I²R heating is low. So you have a high voltage, low current, you can transport a tremendous amount of electricity with very tiny losses. You still need to compare it to pair that.\nI think there’s other sources like hydro, geothermal. I’m actually not against nuclear. I know that some people don’t like nuclear. But I think actually, nuclear in a situation where there’s not natural disasters, is actually fine. I don’t think you want to have nuclear in a place that has lots of earthquakes or tsunamis or something like that, or big hurricanes with a name. But in places where natural disasters are not a concern, I think nuclear is very safe."

I want to have a battery in every house with a garden that all the tools and all the garden equipment can be run on one platform. So, one battery for all tools around the garden and in the house. The key is for sure the battery, same as in the car.\nWe’re working every day on endurance and performance because this is what the customer requires in the car, and also in tools and in garden. The difference, I think is, we have our charger always with us. And when we go all in electricity mobility, what do you think how fast we can charge the cars, and how long it will take us? When everybody drives with the E-car to charge the battery that we have not a complete mess in front of the fueling stations?"

This actually works fairly well with the grid usage because the electricity usage on the grid is mostly during the day. You don’t actually need a lot of new power plants, given that people primarily charge their car at night, at their house.\nNow, not everyone can do that if you park on the street or something. And that’s where you need supercharger stations or charging at work. So total electricity power consumption obviously will increase. I mean, when everything, when all transport goes electric, all road transport going electric will approximately double electricity usage – total electricity usage. Like I said, because most of us do it at night, that doesn’t mean a doubling of the power plants.\nBut we will need to increase the amount of solar and wind, geothermal, hydro, nuclear – I think this is fine, like said – in order to solve the needs of electric vehicles. You know, my guess is that the majority of the electricity production long-term will be photovoltaics solar and paired with batteries, obviously. It’s my guess."

I’d say like my, you know, my sort of algorithm or optimization is like, ‘Okay, what set of things do we need to do to ensure, that increases the probability that the future is going to be good?’\nWe have to solve sustainable energy. This is totally logical. If we cannot solve sustainable energy, then we have unsustainable energy, then it’s just a matter of time before things go… – before civilization collapses. Even if there was not an environmental issue, since the availability of oil is limited, this is not something we can sustain long term. My original interest in electric vehicles was actually not environmental. It was out of concern. Just, you know, studying physics, and I’m like, ‘Wait a second. We immediately transition to solar electric, or we’re going to have a problem, and we run out of oil, civilization collapses.’ That’s the problem.\nNow, of course, the environmental concerns have added to the urgency. Because the more CO2 we put in the oceans and atmosphere, the more we increase the probability that something will go wrong. Like I said, things are much more probability as opposed to certainty. But I think it’s an unwise experiment to dramatically increase the CO2 in the atmosphere and oceans, just given that we know we need to transition anyway because we run out of oil.\nSo why run that experiment? It doesn’t make any sense. We know we have to transition to a sustainable energy economy. Then let’s just get on with it, you know, let’s just get on with it. And not run the crazy experiment and see what happens if the atmosphere has 2000 ppm CO2. This is crazy."

      "text": "A lot. Okay. So, yes, aircraft will certainly go electric. The energy density requirement to have an aircraft with a reasonable range is much greater than for cars or ships. So, my (…32:54) in the envelope calculations suggests that you need about 400 watt-hours per kilogram to have an aircraft with a decent range. This is where with a range where it’s comfortably over 1000 kilometers, including some reserves and, you know, emergency power and that kind of thing.\nAnd then, as you go above 400 watt-hours per kilogram, it gets really better in a nonlinear way because you spend so much of your energy getting to altitude; once you get to altitude, the air is thin, and your cruise power is quite low. If you go to like 450 watt-hours per kilogram, even though it’s, let’s say 460, or 480 watt-hours per kilogram, you will double the range. Even like a 20% increase, let’s say in energy density, we’ll double the range to at least 2000 kilometers, if not more.\nAnd we’re getting there progressively with improvements in the energy density, almost every year. This is just watt-hours per kilogram. And a lot of the improvements of energy density actually also improve the cost because you need less material because you’re able to put more energy in the same amount of material, which means less material per unit of energy. You know, where we are right now is a little over 300 watt-hours per kilogram, and some of the very expensive cells can do over 400 watt-hours per kilogram. But the high-volume cells, I think we’ll start to approach 400 watt-hours per kilogram as well.\nI would expect to see a significant transition to electric aircraft, starting initially with propeller planes because they’re generally more efficient per kilometer than jets. And then turboprops, and then commercial airliners and that kind of thing. That transition probably happens, I think reasonably soon. Within the next five years , we should start to see electric jets."
