Stick around my channel, and I promise I’ll make sense of all the stuff we talk about, like full-flow staged combustion cycle and\naerospike\nengines. There were parts of this interview that I wasn’t really planning to release at first but actually think the best thing I can do is just show you the entire thing, un-cut, from a single camera, so you can feel like you’re right there with us.\n———–"

And then I’ve propagated those lessons to the SpaceX team, and there’s just like an incredibly talented, hard-working team at SpaceX. In fact, at times, I think maybe there’s too many talented people at SpaceX. We have like, you know, too many talented people that we’re cornering the market, or something.\nBut there’s this very talented group that works super hard, and just taking the general approach of, if a design is taking too long, the design is wrong, and therefore, the design must be modified to accelerate progress. And one of the most fundamental errors made in advanced developments is to stick to a design even when it is very complicated and to not strive to delete parts and processes. It’s incredibly important. So, this is why the switch to steel was – because the advanced carbon fiber was taking too long."

But, that said, what I actually used to tell the team, was like, „Everyone is a chief engineer.“ This is extremely important. Everyone must understand how, broadly speaking, all the systems in the vehicle work, so you don’t have self-system optimization because this is naturally what happens.\nYou can see the organizational errors…- The product errors reflect the organizational errors. Essentially, you’ll see that there’s an interface at this particular…- Whatever departments you’ve got, that will be where your interfaces are. And instead of getting rid of something or questioning the constraints, the one department will design to the constraints that the other department has given them without calling into question those constraints and saying, „Those constraints are wrong.“ And you should actually take the approach that the constraints that you are given are guaranteed to be some degree wrong because the counterpoint would be that they are perfect."

And then, what’s your nozzle efficiency, which is really…-  you know, are you straightening the flow, and shooting the molecules out in a straight line, so that you go in the other direction; Newton’s Third Law.\nWith a traditional combustion chamber, you can get to a very high combustion efficiency because the molecules are all sort of bouncing around in there; they’ve got a time to combine and do their thing. And then, when you sort of choking it through the throat, that gives them sort of more opportunity to combine. So, we think we can probably get to ninety…- certainly 98.5, hopefully, 99 percent of theoretical combustion efficiency. This is so… if God himself came and knitted together the molecules, you’re one percent better. Okay, maybe one and a half percent better. That’s very high efficiency."

And with a relatively simple reaction – the only thing that would be simpler would be hydrogen. But you’ve got CH4 and O2; that’s pretty simple. You don’t have any long-chain hydrocarbons. With kerosene, you’ve got the long chains, they’ve got to break down, they’ve got to recombine, it’s a total soup, you know. It’s a part-like dinner situation. It’s very hard to get high combustion efficiency with kerosene.\nSo, when you look at, say like, ‚what’s the theoretical value of a lox/kerosene engine, as compared to a methane engine?‘ The kerosene actually looks more compelling than it really is because you can’t achieve the high combustion efficiency with kerosene that you can with methane. So, you actually want to say, ‚what is the actual achievable combustion efficiency times the theoretical chemical energy?‘ That’s the real number, and this is where methane starts to look really good.\nIt’s very hard to get to like 96 percent combustion efficiency, or even 95 percent combustion efficiency with kerosene, but with methane, you can get 98 easy, 99 with a little bit of difficulty."

I think there may have been some, like, little test things or whatever, but no actual rockets. But I’m very confident that CH4 is the right fuel. Maybe aerospike is right, even though it’s not been done before. But you just have to show that your combustion efficiency is not affected and that you’re straightening the flow sufficiently."
