It’s like $3 trillion federal expenditures, or 7 trillion federal revenue (…) 4 trillion. That’s a $3 trillion difference in… if this was a company, it would be a $3 trillion loss. So I don’t know if we should be adding to that loss. That seems pretty crazy. Someone’s got to give; you can’t just spend $3 trillion more than you own every year and don’t expect something bad to happen. I think this is not good.\nIf I may elaborate on that – the deficit is more than 3 trillion when you look at the future obligations. So it’s 7 trillion of current expenditures. But it’s much more than that. If you look at future obligations for Social Security, Medicare, and so forth – we’re running this incredible deficit. Someone’s gonna give. I don’t know. This can’t keep going."

And, you know, especially in cities that are congested, we’ve got to do something to deal with the extreme traffic, which I think is some combination of double deckering freeways and building tunnels. But if we don’t do something, we will be stuck in traffic forever. And as autonomous vehicles come to the fore, and it’s easier to drive without going through the pain of having to drive yourself – which is absolutely coming and will be one of the biggest transformations ever in human civilization – there will be more cars on the road, and the traffic will get much worse.\nAnd so we really need to do some combination of tunnels and/or like a double deckering freeways. I’m not a big believer in flying cars. They’re basically helicopters with wheels. And people don’t want the skies to be swarming with helicopters. So it’s tunnels and double deckering freeways. We don’t have a traffic problem in suburbs; we have a traffic problem on freeways because they’re just too small and did not anticipate the size of the urban environments that we currently experience. So yeah, but I don’t see a strong effort in this direction."

You said at this conference actually a year ago that you think government should really just be hands-off when it comes to innovation. Though with this bill, there is a lot of support for EVs. And it could be the biggest change that we’ve seen throughout the country in terms of the infrastructure of EVs, and it helps Tesla. What do you think the role of government should be?"
    },
    {
      "role": "elon_musk",
      "text": "I think the role of government should be that of like a referee, but not a player on the field. Generally, government should, I think, just try to get out of the way and not impede progress. I think that there’s a general problem, not just in the US, but in most countries where the rules and regulations keep increasing every year. Rules and regulations are immortal; they don’t die. Occasionally you see some law with a sunset provision. But really, otherwise, the vast majority of rules and regulations live forever.\nAnd so, if more rules and regulations are applied every year, and it just keeps growing and growing, eventually, it just takes longer and longer, and it’s harder to do things. And there’s not really an effective garbage collection system for moving rules and regulations. And so, gradually, this hardens the arteries of civilization, where you’re able to do less and less over time. So I think the government should be really trying hard to get rid of rules and regulations that perhaps had some merit at some point but don’t have merit currently. But there’s very little effort in this direction. This is a big problem."

But I work a lot; I work seven days a week and put in some pretty crazy hours. But it really depends on where I’m needed most. Like, basically just, I triage the tasks and try to do the things that are most useful or where I’m most needed. It varies from one week to the next.\nBut just going back to that infrastructure bill for a second, because some of the criticism of Tesla is like, hey, Tesla gets all these subsidies. But it’s worth noting that for the vehicle purchase tax credit – the $7,500 – Tesla stopped getting that like two years ago, whereas everyone else, I think, except for GM, still gets the $7,500 tax credit. So all of our sales this year, and last year, had nothing to do with the tax credit because we’re no longer eligible because we’ve made so many electric cars.\nTesla has made roughly two-thirds of all the electric cars in the United States. I’m not sure if most people are aware of that. So Tesla has made basically twice as many electric vehicles as the rest of the industry combined. And we don’t need the $7,500 tax credit. I would say, honestly, I would just can this whole bill. Don’t pass it. That’s my recommendation."

And then obviously, there’s like, you know, asset base taxes, the sales tax and everything else. There’s also the estate tax. In generally, I think the estate tax is a good tax. Like, if you think of assets beyond a certain level that are far beyond, let’s say, somebody’s ability to consume, then, at a certain point, really what you’re doing is capital allocation. It’s not money for personal expenditures; what you’re doing is capital allocation.\nAnd it does not make sense to take the job of capital allocation away from people who have demonstrated great skill in capital allocation and give it to an entity that has demonstrated very poor skill in capital allocation, which is the government. I mean, you could think of the government, essentially, as a corporation in the limit. The government is simply the biggest corporation with a monopoly on violence. And where you have no recourse. So, how much money (…) entity?"

      "text": "Yeah, I mean, the government is a corporation in the limit. It is the most corporate thing; it is maximum corporation. But it’s also monopoly. And also is the only one that’s allowed legally to do violence. So, why would you want to give a corporation with no competition, that can’t even really go bankrupt, more money? Now, it’s not as though I think the government shouldn’t exist or that there are not good things that the government can do or things that are necessary for the government to do.\nFor example, a science program’s where we send a probe to Mars, and the value of that is… it’s a small amount of value for all citizens, but it would be inefficient to sort of go and collect, you know, $10 from every citizen for a Mars probe. And therefore, it’s better to have the government do something like a heavy science program, rather than try to collect small amounts of money from everyone.\nSo I’m not somebody who is sort of an extreme libertarian and thinks the government should not do anything. I just think we should minimize what the government does because the government’s efficiency at spending is just going to be lower than a competitive commercial company by a lot.\nIf you look at, say, East Germany versus West Germany, or North Korea versus South Korea, and you look at GDP per capita of East and West Germany or North and South Korea, the difference is gigantic. And that’s just the difference between East and West Germany, you know, it’s like a random line was drawn basically, depending on where the Red Army was and where the Allied troops were. And East Germany’s productivity was at least five times worse than West Germany’s. And it’s not like West Germany was like some bastion of capitalism; they were quite socialist, really. So there may be as much as an order of magnitude difference between the efficiency of a competitive private company versus the government."

And so then we could probably take that same technology and put it in a humanoid robot and have that robot be useful.\nAnd yeah, so essentially, to have the humanoid part, we need to develop some custom actuators and sensors, and then essentially use the Tesla full self-driving autopilot, or just, generally speaking, real-world navigation AI in the humanoid robot.

And no rocket, the best of my knowledge, has ever gotten above 4% of its liftoff mass to orbit.\nSo in order to make a rocket fully reusable, you’ve got to basically create a rocket that can do about 4%, if not more than 4%, of its lift-off mass to orbit, which hasn’t happened before. So that means you have to have basically A+’s across the board, incredibly efficient engines, incredibly efficient structure. You do need scale because there are some efficiencies of scale. That’s why our Starship is so gigantic. Because for example, the brain of the rocket really weighs about the same if it’s a small rocket or a big rocket. So with a big rocket, you get to have the avionics be basically around down to 0% or will be inconsequential in the mass of the vehicle.\nYeah, then you need to make incredibly light heat shield. And just, there’s so many things that need to be done to have both the booster and the upper stage be reusable. Insanely difficult. (…) Many super smart people have tried to do this before, and no one has succeeded. And most of the time, they’ve just given up partway through. But if full and rapid reusability can be achieved, it reduces the cost of access to orbit by a factor of 100 or more.\nIt’s like an aircraft. Imagine if an aircraft or car or any form of transport was not reusable. Imagine if you had to buy a new plane every time you flew. That would make every flight insanely expensive. Or a car – if you had to get a new car every time you drove somewhere, that would be unbelievably expensive as opposed to simply refueling it. So we’ve got to get rockets to the point where we simply refuel the rocket, and we don’t throw it away.\nWith Falcon 9, we’ve managed to make the booster reusable and the fairing/nosecone reusable, but not the upper stage. So we’ve made, I think, the most progress in reusability that has ever been done. But with Starship, we’re hoping to make the whole thing reusable. This is profound like says this is the difference between humanity being a single planet species and a multi-planet species. It’s really that big of a deal."

I wanted to ask you a little bit about humor. You’re a pretty funny guy. You show it on Twitter a lot. You’ve hosted SNL. And I’m wondering how that plays into your management style. I mean, would your co-workers say you’re funny? Is this something you’re sort of bringing to the office now? Has it helped with managing your teams?"

But I’m not poking fun at age. I’m just saying, you know, if we’ve got people in very important positions that have to make decisions that are critical to the security of the country, then they need to have sufficient presence of mind and cognitive ability to make those decisions well, because the whole country’s depending on them."

      "text": "Yeah, I mean, I think we’re at an interesting point in history, where the United States has been the world’s largest economy for as long as anyone can remember. You know, I think US became the largest economy, I don’t know, probably 120, 130 years ago. And there’s nobody that old really anymore who can remember a time when the United States is not the world’s biggest economy. Now, we’re heading towards a situation where China is going to be probably having an economy two to three times the size of the United States. And so that’s just a different world.\nI do think there are a lot of people in the government in China who kind of grew up with China being a small economy and maybe who feel like China was pushed around a lot. But they haven’t fully appreciated the fact that China really is going to be the big kid on the block. And if you’re going to be the big kid on the block, then you can really be pretty chill about things, you know, you don’t have to worry about like, other countries are not really a threat to you if you’re by far the biggest kid on the block.\nAnd so I’d say that’s kind of an important mindset change. Hopefully, that, you know, trying to go through is just… just think, if you’re the biggest kid… like, how would you want the biggest kid on the block to behave? And now, if you are going to be the biggest kid on the block, then wouldn’t you want to behave like you would have wanted the biggest kid on the block to behave? I think that’s pretty important.\nI mean, overall, I think Tesla has a good relationship with China. I don’t mean to endorse everything that China does. Anyone I know wouldn’t say he endorsed everything the United States does. Or any country. But overall, I think we are headed to an interesting, a different world. And I hope that we can remember that we’re all human beings. And let’s just try to have as positive a relationship as possible and work towards mutual prosperity of humanity as a whole."
