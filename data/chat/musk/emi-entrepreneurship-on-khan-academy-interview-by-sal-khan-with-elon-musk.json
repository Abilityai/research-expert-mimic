It’s kind of routed under the carpet, in a difficult place. And it’s literally $3. We basically had to send people throughout the Bay Area to go and buy USB cables."

Plan A was like the normal supply chain process. But what the supplier did was instead of sending our parts in their own package, they grouped it together with a bunch of other stuff for other companies and sent that all via some extremely slow boat from China to LA. And when it got to LA, the other stuff didn’t pass customs. So they wouldn’t let our stuff through because…"

And then we had plan B. We called and said, look, you’ve got to air freight some of these cables – because they’re just little cables – to us. We talked to their US subsidiary and ordered from the US subsidiary, who then communicated to China. But then, because this was another batch of parts, so it was kind of double the order, it exceeded the credit limit that we had. It bounced off the credit limit, so they didn’t ship it."

The three areas were the internet, sustainable energy, and space exploration, particularly if humanity becomes a multi-planet species. You know, there’s kind of like a pretty substantial bifurcation in our future, if we’re either out there among stars  on multiple planets, or if we’re confined to Earth until some obviously eventual extinction.

They were electrolytic capacitors. They actually were pretty good. They had like the energy density of a lead-acid battery, which for a capacitor, that’s a big deal. But they used ruthenium tantalum oxide. I think at the time, there was maybe like one or two tons of ruthenium mined per year in the world. So it’s not a scalable solution. But I thought there could be some solid-state solution, like just using chip-making equipment. That was going to be the basic idea.

And it was like, okay, the internet, I’m pretty sure success is one of the possible outcomes, and it seemed like I could either do a Ph.D. and watch the internet happen, or I could participate and help build in some fashion. I was just concerned with the idea of watching it happen. So I decided to put things on hold and start an Internet company.

But if you’d asked people in 1969 what would 2013 look like, they would have said,  there will be a base on the moon. We would have least sent some people to Mars. And maybe there would even be a base on Mars. There would be like orbiting space hotels. And there would be all this awesome stuff in space. That’s what people expected.\nAnd if you said, well, actually, the United States in 2013 will not be able to send anyone to orbit. But I’ll tell you what will exist is that there will be this device in your pocket that’s like the size of smaller than a deck of cards that has access to all the world’s information, and you can talk to anyone on planet Earth. Even if you’re in some remote village somewhere so long as there’s something called the internet – they wouldn’t know what that means, of course – then you would you be able to communicate with anyone instantly and have access to all of humanity’s knowledge.

I said, well, you know, I’ve always been interested in space, but I don’t think there’s anything that an individual could do in space because it’s the province of government, and usually a large government. But I am curious as to when we’re going to send someone to Mars. So I went to the NASA website to try to figure out where is the place that tells you that. I couldn’t find that. I was like, either I’m bad at looking at the website, or they have a terrible website, because surely there must be a date."

I thought, well, maybe this is a question of national will. Like, do we need to get people excited about space again and try to get NASA a bigger budget, and then we would send people to Mars? So I started researching the area, becoming more familiar with space, reading lots of books.\nI came up with this idea to do a so-called Mars oasis, which was to send a small greenhouse with seeds in dehydrated gel that, upon landing, you hydrate the gel. You have green plants on a red background. The public responses to precedents and superlatives. So it would be the first life on Mars, the furthest that life’s ever traveled. And you’d have this money shot of green plants on a red background. That seemed like it would get people pretty excited. So I started getting into this and trying to figure out, okay, well, can I afford to build a spacecraft? Because I had some money as a result of PayPal, but it had to fit within that budget. I figured we had to do two missions because if we only did one and it failed, then it might have the opposite effect."

But the thing is that – their premise for talking me out of it was, well, we think you’re going to lose the money that you invest. I was like, well, that was my expectation anyway, so I don’t really mind if I lose… – I mean, I mind, but I mean it’s not like I was trying to figure out the rank-ordered best way to invest money and on that basis chose space. It’s not like that I thought, wow…"

I just thought that it was important that humanity expands beyond Earth, and we weren’t doing that, so maybe there was something I could do to kind of spur that on. Then, I was able to compress the costs of the spacecraft and everything down to a relatively manageable number. And I got stuck on the rocket. The US rockets were way too expensive. I ended up going to Russia.  I flew to Russia three times to negotiate a purchase of an ICBM\n(Intercontinental Ballistic Missile)\n. I tried to buy two of the biggest ICBMs in the Russian fleet in 2001 and 2002. And I actually negotiated a price."

      "text": "Yeah. I engaged a bunch of consultants and started to kind of get familiar with the space industry. But then, after the third trip to Russia, I came to realize that I was actually wrong about my first premise, that there was a lack of will. In fact, I think that there’s a tremendous amount of will in the United States for space exploration. Because the United States is essentially a nation of explorers. I mean, it’s a distillation of the human spirit of exploration.\nSo, of course, it was quite silly of me to think that people lacked motivation. But what people don’t want to think is that, okay, sending people to Mars is going to be so expensive that they’ll have to give up health care or something. They’re not going to do that. It’s got to be that going to Mars is not going to cause some meaningful drop in their standard of living. So, if it’s like maybe a quarter of a percent or half a percent of GDP – something like that is palatable. Anyways, I thought, okay, it’s not really going to maybe matter that much if I do this mission because what really matters is having a way. I was wrong; I thought there wasn’t enough will, but there actually was plenty of will if people thought there was a way.\nSo I said, okay, well, I need to work on the way. How hard is it really to make a rocket? Historically, all rockets have been expensive, so, therefore, in the future, all rockets will be expensive. But actually, that’s not true. If you say, what is a rocket made of? And say, it’s made of aluminum, titanium, copper, carbon fiber, if you want to go that direction. And you can break down and say, what is the raw material cost of all these components. And if you have them stacked on the floor and could wave a magic wand so that the cost of rearranging the atoms was zero, then what would the cost of the rocket be.\nAnd I was like, wow, it’s really small. It’s like 2% of what a rocket costs. So clearly, it would be in how the atoms are arranged. You’ve got to figure out to how can we get the atoms in the right shape much more efficiently. I had a series of meetings on Saturdays with people, some of whom were still working at the big aerospace companies, just to try to figure out, is there some catch here that I’m not appreciating. And I couldn’t figure it. There didn’t seem to be any catch. So I started SpaceX."
