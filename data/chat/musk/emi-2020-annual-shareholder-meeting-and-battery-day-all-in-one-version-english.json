      "text": "Everyone. Well, I mean, this is definitely a new approach. We’ve got the Tesla drive-in movie theater, basically. It’s good to see everyone. It’s a little hard to read the room with everyone being in cars, but it’s the only way we can do it. So hopefully, it’s cool. And hopefully, you can hear me. Can you guys hear me?\n(hooting)\nOkay. All right. Great.\nWell, thanks for coming. I think it’s been an incredible year, and I’d like to just thank you for your support through tough times, good times. It’s been great. Really appreciate everyone who’s put their heart and money into Tesla, and I think it’s worked out pretty well. This has been a good year. And I think there’s many good years to come. So I’ll go through the shareholder presentation fairly quickly because the real main event here is Battery Day. And really, I’m just going through a recap of what’s happened over the past year or so.\nIn terms of our ability to create a factory, huge kudos to the Tesla Shanghai team for being able to go from literally a dirt pile to volume production in 15 months. It’s like, damn. Yeah. And I think something that’s really quite noteworthy here is, Tesla’s the only foreign manufacturer to have a hundred percent owned factory in China. So this is often not well understood or not appreciated, but to have the only hundred percent owned foreign factory in China is a really big deal, and it’s paying huge dividends here.\nSo we really wouldn’t have the results that we have had this year without the great efforts of the Tesla China team, so I’m super appreciative of that. And we’ll see the Shanghai factory continue to scale quite a bit from where it is right now. I think we really could expect that to be, over time, a factory that produces over a million vehicles a year.\n(hooting)\nYeah, it’s cool. So let’s see. So we also reached in the past year of volume production of the Model Y, and this was the smoothest launch that we’ve ever had, so I think we’re definitely getting better at new vehicle launches and building factories, and scaling production. As you’ve heard me say before, the hardest thing is scaling production, especially of a new technology. It’s insanely difficult.\nMaking a prototype is relatively easy. And if I think, like, what is the real achievement of Tesla in sort of car company terms, it’s like it wasn’t making sort of exciting prototypes. It was that Tesla was really the first company in about a century in the U.S., the first U.S. company in the U.S. to reach volume production and be sustainably profitable. The crazy thing is this has really not happened in a hundred years. That’s the actual super hard part, and we now have four vehicles in volume production: S, 3, X, Y\n(SEXY)\n. Also, the toughest joke, I think, maybe ever. It was a very difficult joke to make.\nWe also introduced the lowest cost solar in the U.S. – it’s only $1.49/Watt. We really just simplified the whole value chain, so reduced sales and advertising, got rid of a bunch of unnecessary costs, and really are just relying upon the fact that it’s just the lowest cost, most efficient solar in the U.S., providing both a retrofit and the solar glass roof, which I think is a really great product – a hard product to make work – that will be a major product line in the future.\nAnd we also got four consecutive quarters of GAAP profitability, which was very difficult. Yeah. And certainly, a testament to the hard work of people at Tesla. I mean, to do this in extremely difficult times against a wide range of adverse circumstances was insanely hard , but we got it done. And I think the future is looking, I think, very promising from a sort of an annual profitability standpoint.\nSo in order to sort of do well financially, you really need economies of scale, and you need ideally the best technology, and I think we’ve had the best technology for a while, but now we are also achieving economies of scale. And we’re also rapidly improving autonomy, which is a massive value add to each car. So, I think the value of Tesla is going to be like total, just on the vehicle side, total vehicles produced times the value of autonomy. That’s a way to think about the future value of Tesla.\nWe also have consistent free cashflow generation. This is really important for growth. A key element here is tightening up the time from when a car is ordered to when it is built and delivered. So for a company that is growing rapidly, it’s extremely important to tighten the supply chain and to have, from when parts arrive, put it into a car very quickly and deliver the car very quickly to the customer. And if you can do that inside sort of ahead of your payables timeline, then the faster you grow, the more cash you have.\nOr conversely, if you’re unable to do it within your payables timeline, the faster you grow, the less money you will have, which is obviously bad for capital intensive situation. So just tightening up and having the parts move very quickly to the factory, put it in a car, get it to a customer makes a massive difference to cashflow generation.\nThat’s why it’s extremely important to have a factory on each continent because if you don’t at least have a factory in the continent, it isn’t impossible to achieve this. So having a factory in China that’s able to serve China, and then soon many other countries in the region will be key to us tightening that total sort of chain of cashflow, and getting… essentially the faster we grow, the more cash. This is really important. That’s also why it’s important to have Giga Berlin complete because then we’ll have a factory in China, a factory in the U.S., and soon a second factory in the U.S. in Austin, and a factory in Europe.\nI mean, even if for Giga Texas in Austin – even if we had exactly the same cost as in California, it would still be advantageous to do it there because it’s roughly two-thirds of the way across the U.S., so in terms of delivering cars to the central U.S. and to the East Coast, it’s just faster, it costs less, and it fundamentally improves our economics. So I think this is also maybe something that’s not fully appreciated of just how important it is to have a factory at least on the continent or reasonably close to where the end customers are, so you can tighten that whole chain.\nIndustry performance. While the rest of industry has gone down, Tesla has gone up. And so I’d like to thank all the customers for taking a chance on Tesla and buying our product and really hope you’re enjoying it. This is really –  our sales, as I was saying, it really grew by word of mouth. So this is really, I think, very pure in the sense that it’s growing on the basis of existing owners recommending it to others, to new customers. This is, really, I think, a good way to grow.\nSo, and then in 2019, we had 50% growth, and I think we’ll do really pretty well in 2020. Probably somewhere between 30-40% growth, despite a lot of very difficult circumstances. I mean, there’s so many… pandemic, wildfires – it’s a whole bunch of difficult production issues, but thanks to the hard work of the Tesla team and a lot of innovative approaches to overcoming issues, we’re able to still see significant growth in one of the most difficult… in fact, I’d say probably the most difficult year of Tesla’s existence.\nWe also published our extended Impact Report. At Tesla, we try very hard to do the right thing. If the right thing does not happen, it’s just because we maybe made a mistake or weren’t aware of it. But we always try to do the right thing  to the best of our ability. And then we published the extended impact report to show, you know, just a sort of self-examination of, okay, what are we doing right, what are we doing wrong, what can we do better in the future? We’re definitely trying to accomplish the most good, and so if we occasionally make a mistake, we work quickly to fix it and do the right thing.\nSo it’s worth looking at the average life cycle of emissions in the U.S. and just how much better a Tesla is or electric car than any kind of gasoline car, and what we’ll talk about in the Battery Day is also just how much the grids around the world, and actually especially in the U.S., are greening. It’s actually much faster than I think people realize, the U.S. is moving towards sustainable energy.\nAnd so as we move more and more to sustainable energy, then effectively you end up building the solar factories and the car factories themselves with solar or with sustainable energy. Over time, you will even mine with sustainable energy, and eventually, it will get to an effective emissions of zero, so that’s where things will end up. Yeah.\nSo, we also have safety at the core of our design. The Tesla cars are the safest cars ever designed. We have the lowest probability of injury of any cars ever tested by the U.S. government. And that’s just passive safety. When you add active safety into that, it’s even better, so it’s really … If safety is important to you, which obviously it is, the safest car you could drive is a Tesla. So, I think some people aren’t aware of this, but it’s really safety is paramount. It is actually the number one design objective when we build a Tesla is safety.\nOur factories are also becoming safer, and if you look at the sort of accidents per vehicle, total vehicle made, it’s dramatically better than in the past, and it’s already better than industry average, and we’re confident we can get it to the best in the auto industry.\nAutopilot functionality continues to improve, and you can see it in the safety report that we publish every quarter. It’s just getting better and better. The U.S. average for collisions is at roughly 2.1 per million miles, and with autopilot engaged, it’s 0.3. I mean, this is a profound difference, really massive, and this will get even better. So we’re confident that over time we can get the probability of an accident, especially the probability of injury, to 10 times better than the industry average, like an order of magnitude better. So that’s a lot of lives saved and a lot of injuries avoided, so that’s a huge priority for us.\nOn the autopilot front – I think it’s kind of hard for people to judge the progress of autopilot. I’m driving… As a matter – of course, I’ve always done this – I drive the bleeding edge alpha build of autopilot, and so I sort of have insight into what is going on. Previously, about a couple of years ago, we were kind of stuck in a local maximum, so we’re improving, but the improvements kind of started tailing off and just not getting where they needed to be. I call this sort of getting trapped in a local maximum. So we had to do a fundamental rewrite of the entire autopilot software stack and all of the labeling software as well.\nSo we are now labeling in 3D video. So this is hugely different from the previously where we were labeling essentially a bunch of single images from eight cameras, and they would be labeled at different times by different people, and some of the labels – you literally can’t tell what it is you’re labeling. So it basically made it in some cases impossible to label, and the labels had a lot of errors.\nNow with our new labeling tools, we label it in video. We actually label entire video segments. And the system… so you get basically a surround video thing to label with the surround video and with time. It’s now taking all cameras simultaneously and looking at how the image change over time and labeling that . And then the sophistication of the neural nets in the car and the overall logic in the car has improved dramatically.\nI think we’ll hopefully release a private beta of autopilot, of the full self-driving version of autopilot in, I think, a month or so, and then people will really understand just the magnitude of the change. It’s profound. Anyway, so you’ll see it. It’s just like a hell of a step change. But because we had to rewrite everything, labeling software, just the entire code base, it took us quite a while. The sort of new … I call it like 4D in the sense that it’s three dimensions plus time. It’s just taken us a while to rewrite everything, and so you’ll see what it’s like. It’s amazing. Yeah. It’s just clearly going to work.\nAt Tesla, the core competencies – we’ve got engineering, obviously, but also manufacturing. I think manufacturing is underappreciated in general. The difficulty of designing the machine that makes the machine is vastly harder than the machine itself. So the designing, like making a Model 3 or Model Y or Cybertruck prototype, is really quite trivial compared to designing the factory that makes it. Especially if it’s new technology, and you want to use new manufacturing methods, it’s just at least 10 to 100 times harder to do the factory than the prototype.\nAnd that’s why you see a lot of companies out there or startups; they’ll bring out a prototype, but they just can’t get it over the hump for manufacturing because manufacturing – of new technology especially – is the hardest thing by far. Basically, the prototype is at best 10% of the difficulty and probably closer to 1%.\nAnd then software. Tesla is both a hardware and a software company. So a huge percentage of our engineers are actually software engineers. You can think of our car as kind of like a laptop on wheels. So software is incredibly important, actually, not just in the car, but also in the factory. So the factory software is extremely important – just software in general. I mean, these are fundamental. These are the three critical areas that are needed to make for an awesome company.\nWe’ll soon have three new factories incremental on – well, we have one already – on three different continents. Shanghai – we’re expanding the Shanghai with the second phase. Berlin is making rapid progress, and Texas is making even faster progress. With each factory, what we’re trying to do is also improve the manufacturing technology, so in some cases, like the Model Y made in Berlin might look the same, but it actually is made in a much more efficient way. We’ll talk about that later in the battery presentation.\nWe launched Megapack. It’s three megawatt hours all-in-one energy storage solution, so it’s been great overall.\nAnd I think that’s basically it, right? Well, thanks, everyone, for coming, and we’ll be back in a little bit to go through the battery stuff. And there’s a little bit more in addition to the battery stuff, we’ve got a few extras as well. So I think you’ll really like what we have to say on batteries. The battery stuff we’re going to talk about is truly revolutionary and essential to Tesla’s goal.\nThe fundamental good of Tesla, it’s like, if you look back in history and say, “What good did Tesla do?” The good will be by how many years did we accelerate sustainable energy? That’s the true metric of success. It matters if sustainable energy happens faster or slower, and so that’s really how I think about Tesla and how we should assess our progress. By how many years did we accelerate sustainable energy? And what we’re going to talk about with batteries and a few other things will really explain how we’re going to make a step-change improvement in the acceleration of sustainable energy. Thank you."

      "text": "Yeah. So anyway, there is a lot of good news, though. A lot of people may not be aware that wind and solar comprise 75% of new electricity capacity in the US this year. So, this is really major. The grid is going sustainable very quickly. Now, it’s also worth noting that the length of time that power plants last is on the order of 25 years. So even if 100% of energy generation was sustainable, it will still take 25 years to convert the grid. And it’s also worth noting that in the past ten years, power production from coal has dropped in half. It went from 46% of electricity in 2010 to 23% in 2020. This is a massive improvement. So, good things are happening on a lot of levels. We just need to go faster.\nSo, Tesla’s contribution: we’ve delivered over a million electric vehicles, 26 billion electric miles driven, and many gigawatt-hours\n(GWh)\nof stationary batteries, 17 terawatt-hours\n(TWh)\nof solar-generated. I think solar is sometimes underweighted at Tesla, but it is a massive part of our future. The three parts of a sustainable energy future are sustainable energy generation, storage, and electric vehicles. We intend to play a significant role in all three.\nTo accelerate the transition to sustainable energy, we must produce more EVs that need to be affordable and a lot more energy storage while building factories faster and with far less investment.\nSo, goal number one is a terawatt-hour scale battery production. So, Tera is the new Giga. And a terawatt is a thousand times more than a gigawatt. We used to talk in terms of gigawatts, in the future, we’ll be talking in terms of terawatt-hours. This is what’s needed in order to transition the world to sustainability."

      "role": "elon_musk",
      "text": "Yeah, and I think we should view this as more than just a question of money. Money is sort of an material thing,  but it’s really the amount of effort. You have a certain amount of effort in terms of people and machines, and depending on how efficient that effort is, for a given amount of effort, you want the most amount of batteries. It’s not just the question of, well, if we have $2 trillion, tomorrow you could make this. It’s not that easy. You actually need to organize a massive number of people, build a lot of machines, build the machines that make the machines. And so it’s incredibly important to have that effort yield the most number of batteries.\nAnd then goal two: obviously we need to make more affordable cars. I think one of the things that troubles me the most is that we don’t yet have a truly affordable car, and that is something that we will make in the future. But in order to do that, we’ve got to get the cost of batteries down, and we’ve got to be better at manufacturing. And we need to do something about this curve. The curve of the cost per kilowatt-hour of batteries is not improving fast enough. We’ve given this a lot of thought over many years to say, okay, how can we radically improve the cost per kilowatt-hour curve? It’s been somewhat flattening out actually in recent years."

When you open that cell, you’ve got a tab connected to those terminals, what we call the jelly roll, which is the wound electrodes on the inside. You can actually see what this looks like as you unwind it. This is over a meter long in a typical 2170 cell. So, it’s quite a long winding process. And you can see the tab still there. And then to explain what’s actually going on here, we’ve identified, we’ve got anode, cathode, separator, positive and negative terminal.\nWatch what happens as we – there we go – discharge the cell. Got lithium moving from anode to cathode. And then the reverse, when we charge the cell, lithium moving from cathode to anode across the separator. This is the basic of what makes all lithium-ion batteries, no matter what the form factor is.\nAnd when we look at what’s happened today, at least in our products, we’ve moved from the 18650 form factor to the 2170 form factor through great collaboration with our partners, Panasonic, new partners like LG and CATL, and probably others in the future."

So that helps explain what’s up with these weird numbers. But nobody could explain to me why there was an extra zero.  So I, so I said, “Okay, well, we’re deleting the zero that nobody can explain in future form factors.” So that’s why it’s technically, it’s like the 18650 bizarrely, but going forward, it’s the 2170 because we just got rid of the extra zero because it’s pointless."

But when we look to the ideal cell design, if we were to do it ourselves, we need to go beyond just what we’re looking at us in front of us and study the full spectrum of options. As you can see, we kind of swept the key figures of merit, how much we can reduce the cost and how much vehicle range increases as we change the outer diameter of the cell. We found a sweet spot somewhere around 46 millimeters. But it’s not just about a bigger form factor. Anybody could make a bigger form factor."

And now that you’ve been teased on this factory, we’re going to go on and walk step-by-step through that factory and discuss a series of innovations there.\nWhen thinking about the ideal cell factory, we have inspirations behind us in the paper and bottling industry, wherefrom humble beginnings, over a century of innovation has enabled mass scale, continuous motion, unbelievably low manufacturing costs. And when we think about the lithium-ion industry, which is really only in its third decade of high-volume production, it has so far to go to achieve similar scale and simplicity. And that was the inspiration that we set out to the team as we thought about how to marry cell design and manufacturing in the best possible factory.\nAnd let’s talk a little bit about what’s in a cell factory. First, there’s an electrode process where the active materials are coated into films onto foils. Then those coated foils are wound in the winding process we just talked about where if you do have tabs, you have to start and stop a lot. Then the jelly roll is assembled into the can, sealed, filled with electrolyte, and then sent to formation where the cell is charged for the first time and where the sort of the electrochemistry is set and the quality of the cell is verified.\nAnd we set out at every step of this process to try to take that inspiration we just showed and think about how we make those processes fundamentally better and more scalable. And one of the most important processes is where it all begins, the wet process of the electrode coding. And just to give you all a sense of scale, I’m going to walk through what’s in that wet process.\nYou’ve got mixing where the powders are mixed with either a water or a solvent, solvents for the cathode. That mix then goes into a large coat and dry oven where the slurry is coated onto the foil, huge ovens, tens of meters long, dried, and that solvent then has to be recovered. You can see the solvent recovery system. And then, finally, the coated foil is compressed to the final density. And when you’re looking at this, you’re like, wow, that’s a lot of equipment for one step, especially when you consider that little spec next to the coating oven is a person. This is serious iron involved in making batteries.\nWouldn’t it be great if we could skip that solvent step, which is one of those dig a ditch, and then fill it kind of things where you put the solvent in and then take it out and recycle it, and just go straight to a dry mix to coat? And that’s what the dry process really is about. And in the most basic form, you can see it here on a benchtop, literally powder into film, as simple as that."

But the dry coating they had was like, it’s like a sort of, I would call proof of concept.\nSince the acquisition, we’ve actually ramped the machine that does dry coating four times, so a revision full post acquisition of the machine. And there’s still a lot of work to do. So I would not say this is completely in the bag. It’s still a lot of work to do. And as you grow, as you scale, go from benchtop to lab to pilot to volume production, there are actually major issues that you encounter at every level. It’s not like you make something work on your bench and bingo, now you can make a bazillion of it."

It’s like speed and density. A factory that’s moving at, say, twice the speed of another factory is equivalent to two factories, basically. And the company that will be successful is the company that with one factory can accomplish what other companies take two or three or four factories to do.

I think we need to have a kind of a three-tiered approach to batteries starting with iron, that’s kind of like a medium range, and then nickel manganese as sort of a medium plus intermediate and then high nickel for long-range applications like Cybertruck and the Semi.\nFor something like a semi-truck, it’s extremely important to have high energy density in order to get long range. And just to give sort of iron a bit more time, if you look at the watt-hours per kilogram at the cathode level of iron, it looks like nickel’s twice as good. But when you fully consider it at the pack level, everything else taken into account, nickel is about maybe 50 or 60% better than iron.\nSo, iron is a little better than it would seem when you look at it at the pack level fully considered. It’s not as good as nickel, nickel’s like 50 to 60% better, but it’s actually pretty good – good for stationary storage and for medium-range applications where energy density is not paramount.

Effectively, if you start at the left and you have the metal from the mine, the first thing that happens is the metal from the mine is changed into an intermediate thing called a metal sulfate, because that just happened to be what chemists wanted a long time ago. And then when you’re making the cathode, you have to take this intermediate thing called the metal sulfate, add chemicals, add a whole bunch of water, a whole bunch of stuff happens in the middle, and at the end, you get that little bit of cathode and a whole bunch of wastewater and by-products."

So we can eliminate billions in battery grade nickel intermediate production. It’s not needed at all. And we can also use that same process we showed on the previous page to directly consume the metal powder coming out of recycled electric vehicles and grid storage batteries. So this process enables both simpler mining and simpler recycling.\nAnd now that we have this process, obviously we’re going to go and start building our own cathode facility in North America and leveraging all of the North American resources that exist for nickel and lithium.

Nobody’s done this before; to the best of my knowledge, nobody’s done this. And all the elements are reusable; it’s a very sustainable way of obtaining lithium.

      "text": "So there’s an architecture that we’ve been wanting to do at Tesla for a long time, and we’ve finally  figured it out. And I think it’s the way that all electric cars in the future will ultimately be made. It’s the right way to do things.\nIt starts with having a single piece casting for the front body and the rear body. And in order to do this, we commissioned the largest casting machine that has ever been made. And it’s currently working just over the road at our Fremont plant. It’s pretty sweet. Currently making the entire rear section of the car as a single piece, high-pressure die-cast aluminum.\nAnd in order to do this, we actually had to develop our own alloy because we wanted a high-strength casting alloy that did not require coatings or heat treatment. This is a big deal for castings, especially with a large casting. If you heat treat it afterwards, it tends to deform. It kind of does this like potato chip thing. So it’s very hard to keep a large casting to have its shape.\nSo, in order to achieve this – there was no alloy that existed that could do this – so we developed our own alloy, a special alloy of aluminum that has high strength without heat treat and is very castable. So that’s a great achievement of our materials team. In fact, in general, we’ve got a lot of advanced materials coming for Tesla – new alloys and materials – that have never existed before.\nSo, you’re basically making the front and rear of the car is a single piece, and that then interfaces to what we call the structural battery, where the battery for the first time will have dual use. The battery will both have the use as an energy device and as structure. This is absolutely the way things are done. In the early days of aircraft, they would carry the fuel tanks as cargo. So the fuel tanks actually were quite difficult to carry. They’re basically worse than cargo; you had to kind of bolt them down. It was very difficult.\nAnd then somebody said, “Hey, what if we just make the fuel tank in wing shape?” So all modern airplanes – your wing is just a fuel tank in wing shape. This is absolutely the way to do it. And then the fuel tanks serve this dual structure, and it’s no longer cargo. It’s fundamental to the structure of the aircraft. This was a major breakthrough. We’re doing the same for cars.\nSo this is really quite profound. Effectively the non-cell portion of the battery has negative mass. We saved more mass in the rest of the vehicle than the non-cell portion of the battery. So it’s like, “How do you really minimize the mass of a battery? Make it negative. Make the non-cell portion of battery pack negative.” So it also allows us to pack the cells more densely because we do not have intermediate structure in the battery pack. So instead of having these supports and stabilizers and stringers and structural elements in the battery, we now have a lot more space in the battery because the pack itself is structural.\nWhat we do essentially, instead of having just a filler that is a flame retardant, which is currently what is in the 3 and Y battery packs, we have a filler that is a structural adhesive, as well as flame-retardant. So it effectively glues the cells to the top and bottom sheet. And this allows you to do shear transfer between upper and lower sheet. Just like if you have a formula one craft or a racing boat, and you have carbon fiber face sheets and aluminum honeycomb between them, this gives you incredible stiffness, and it’s really the way that any super fast thing works is you create basically a honeycomb sandwich with two face sheets.\nThis is actually even better than what aircraft do. Because aircraft do not do this. They can’t do this because fuel is liquid. So in our case, the batteries are solid. So we can actually use the steel shell case of the battery to transfer shear from the upper and lower face sheet, which makes for an incredibly stiff structure, even stiffer than a regular car. In fact, if this was a convertible that had no upper structure, that convertible will be stiffer than a regular car. So it’s just really major.\nSo it improves the mass efficiency of the battery. And then, those castings are also quite important because you want to transfer load into the structural battery pack in a very smooth, continuous way. So you don’t put arbitrary point loads into the battery. So you want to sort of feather the load out from the front and rear into the structural battery.\nIt also allows us to move the cells closer to the center of the car because we don’t have the… in the top one, we’ve got all the supports and stuff, so the volumetric efficiency of the structural pack is much better than a non-structural pack. And we’re going to actually bring the cells closer to the center. And because they’re closer to the center, it reduces the probability of a side impact potentially contacting the cells because any kind of side impact has to go further in order to reach the cells.\nIt also proves what’s called the polar moment of inertia which is if you think of when there’s an ice skater arms out or arms in. Arms in, you rotate faster. So if you can bring things closer to the center, you reduce the polar moment of inertia, and that means the car maneuvers better. It just feels better. You won’t know why, but it just feels more agile. So it’s really cool. This is really major. Like I said, so 10% mass reduction in the body of the car, 14% range increase, 370 fewer parts. I really think that, long-term, any cars that do not take this architecture will not be competitive."

So range increase, we’re unlocking up to 54% increase in range for our vehicles and energy density for our energy products. 56% reduction in $/kWh at the battery pack level, and a 69% reduction in investment per GWh, which is the true enabler when we talk back about how do we achieve this scale problem here."

So if we could do this instantly, we would, but it just really bodes well for the future and means that the long-term scaling of Tesla and the sustainable energy products that we make will be massively increased.

It’s tiny, it’s efficient, it has to last for 15 years,  it’s got to work in all kinds of conditions from the coldest winter to the hottest summer. So we’ve actually already done a massive amount of the work necessary for a really kick-ass home HVAC.\nAnd they could also stack them. So if you want to say, depending upon the size of your house or whatever, how much you need, you can just basically stack them and just have a very compelling, super-efficient home HVAC. And then you could also communicate with the car, and it’ll know when you’re coming home. So it’s like, “Oh, I don’t need to keep the house cold all day. I’ll just cool it down because I knew you were coming home.” So the pack can communicate with the car and just really dial it into when you actually need cooling and heating. It’ll be great."

Is its volume… – you know, trucks are so popular in America. Do you see its volume equaling the 3 or the Y in the future?

So I think there’s probably room for, I don’t know, at least like a unit volume of like 250,000 to 300,000 a year, maybe more.\nNow, we are designing the Cybertruck to meet the American spec. Because if you try to design a car to meet the superset of all global requirements, you can’t make the Cybertruck; it’s impossible. So it really is designed for the American market, but this is the biggest market. Our North American market is the biggest market for pickup trucks by far or large pickup trucks.\nAnd then I think we’ll probably make an international version of the Cybertruck that’ll be kind of smaller, kind of like a tight Wolverine package. It’ll still be cooler, but it’ll be smaller because you just can’t make a giant truck like that for most markets. So, yeah, but it’s going to be great. And I don’t know. I think probably we’ll be able to sell directly in Texas. We do pretty well right now.

I should say, I try to view the whole climate thing as a science question as much as possible. Science, you always question your hypothesis. Is it true? Is not true? Or assign a probability to a given hypothesis. And I should say that my original interest  in electric vehicles predates the climate issue. When I was in high school, I thought, “Man, if we don’t figure out electric cars, the whole economy’s going to collapse when we run out of oil.” So we better figure out electric cars and sustainable energy, or civilization’s going to crumble.\nAnd then it was only later that the significance of the climate risk became apparent. And we were also able, using\nfracking\nand other types of technology to access a lot more fossil fuels than previously thought, which is helpful for lowering the cost of gasoline, but it’s pretty bad for the total tonnage of CO2 that you could put in the atmosphere. It’s now greatly beyond what people previously thought.\nAs we were just going through this presentation, it is an absolutely monumental task to accelerate the advent of sustainable energy. The entire global economy is still more than 99% dependent on – or call it roughly 99% – dependent on fossil fuels. So although electric cars get a lot of press right now, as a percentage of the total global fleet, it’s practically nothing. I would say, yes, less than 1% of the global fleet is electric right now because of two billion cars and trucks and whatnot in use.\nSo there’s a massive amount of work ahead. Just insane, like hard to comprehend how much work is ahead to get the new vehicle production to be sustainable, to massively increase the amount of stationary storage, which is critical because renewable energy is intermittent. Wind and solar are intermittent. Sometimes the wind doesn’t blow and, this is obvious, the sun doesn’t shine at night. So you got to have batteries – a massive, massive number of batteries."

And then on the solar side and wind, with the cost of solar wind coming down and with batteries coming down with them, the actual cost of energy on the grid is going down.

First, thanks for having everyone. I was telling a friend, the one company to go work for that’s going to have the biggest structural impact over the next ten years at scale, it’s probably Tesla. So kudos to everyone at Tesla for what they’ve done to this point and going forward.\nThe two questions for you: As you’ve looked at the auto in the storage markets – I know you’ve talked about it at kind of 50/50 long-term – but it seems like a lot of the battery cost curve achievements that you presented today really make some of these storage opportunities much more feasible over the next five years. And so I guess the first part of the question is, does your calculus upon learning and improving these things change on that 50/50 mix, or is there a role where storage becomes bigger?\nAnd then the second part of the question: With all these huge grand visions, who’s going to be with Tesla from a corporate perspective, accomplishing these things?

So we’re making some decent progress on sustainability on the rocket front, but there’s just no way to have an electric rocket.

Tesla has clearly made the right moves that are necessary, but there’s a real worry that the potential supply issues and price spikes will create a drag on the rest of the EV industry and, therefore, a drag on global EV adoption.

I guess we can try to basically overdo it in cell production and perhaps supply cells to others, but we do see the fundamental constraint as total cell production. That’s why we’re putting so much effort into making cells and try to reinvent every aspect of cell production, from mining the ore to a complete battery pack, because it’s the fundamental constraint.\nWe’re not getting into the cell business just for the hell of it; it’s because it’s the fundamental constraint. It’s the thing that is the limiting factor for rapid growth. But we could certainly try to overdo it on cell production and perhaps sell cells to others, although we are going at absolute top speed, so it’s not like we’re holding it back.\nI think just making really efficient cars that have lower drag coefficient, low rolling resistance, efficient powertrains – I mean, that’s kind of what we’ve done in order to make iron phosphate still have a good range. So the iron phosphate’s  a lower energy density solution, but while there are some limitations on the total amount of nickel produced every year, there’s really no limit on the iron. There’s so much iron it’s ridiculous. So you can really scale up iron phosphate at a raw materials basis, more than you can nickel."

What we need to see is vertical integration that shortens the process path, from mine to cathode. And what we’re doing here is novel, and we’re trying to push the industry in that direction.

It’s definitely not an intentional effort to keep the cells to ourselves. If we can make enough for other companies, we will supply them. And we were trying to do the right thing for advancing the sustainable energy, whatever that is.\nVehicle to grid\n– we get asked that a lot. I think one of the things that’s important to note is, vehicle to grid, unless you have a power cutoff, you need to cut off your main supply to the grid. Otherwise, if you lose the power in your house, you’ll basically just  backflow energy to the grid. So just having a reversal in the power flow does not actually keep the lights on. You need a whole separate system to cut off power to the grid.\nAnd I think there’s also the case that people really want the freedom to be able to drive and to charge at their house. And it’s obviously very problematic if you get to morning and your car, instead of being charged, it discharged into the house, and then you’re sort of, “Okay, now I can either drive or use the battery to power my house.”\nI think it’s actually going to be better for people’s freedom of action to have a power wall and a car separate, and then everything works. You basically combine that with solar, either solar retrofit or\nsolar glass roof\n, and local battery storage, so you basically become your own utility. And then the car can be charged also with solar. I think that’s the stuff that works. That said, we can certainly do vehicle to grid; I think we can basically enable that with software in Europe or something, right?"

It’s unfortunate. So, you’d need an additional hardware to do that.\nBut yeah, in the future, all versions of our vehicles will be able to at least do bi-directional power flow for the purposes of energy market participation. But even for that, it’s important to remember that your car isn’t plugged in 24/7, so it’s kind of an unpredictable resource for the grid.

The sheer amount of hardcore engineering done at Tesla is insane. And if you look at say, there’s various surveys done of engineering schools, where do you want to go, what’s your top choices?
