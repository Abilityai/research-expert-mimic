If you basically organized a company… How does this wealth arise? If you organize people in a better way to produce products and services that are better than what existed before, and you have some ownership in that company, then that essentially gives you the right to allocate more capital. There’s a conflation of consumption and capital allocation.\nTake Warren Buffet, for example, and to be totally frank, I’m not his biggest fan, but you know, he does like have full allocation, and he reads a lot of annual reports of companies and all the accounting, and it’s pretty boring really. He’s trying to figure out does Coke or Pepsi deserve more capital?\nI mean it’s kind of a boring job if you ask me. It’s still a thing that’s important to figure out. Like, which is a company deserving of more or less capital. Should that company grow or expand? Is it making products and services that are better than others or worse? If a company is making compelling products and services, it should get more capital, and if it’s not, it should get less or go out of business."

Now the computer can communicate at a hundred terabytes. Certainly, you know, gigabits are trivial at this point.\nBasically, your computer could do things a million times faster.

Then you say those words, and those words are then interpreted, then they’re decompressed by the person who is listening.
