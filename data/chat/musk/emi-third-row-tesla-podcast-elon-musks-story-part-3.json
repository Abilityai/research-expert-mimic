I remember my brother and I pressing ‘go’ on his server at our office and it took about 60 seconds for the first door-to-door directions to come up on the screen. And even 60 seconds was amazing.

And they were building it for Hertz NeverLost, which came out a few years later. You know, those things that no one uses in the GPS systems. Really bad technology, but the actual mapping data was amazing. And so we took that and applied it to the internet. We were 22 and 23 at the time. It had cost them $300 million to build this data, and they gave it to us for free, with a simple contract saying, if you ever make any money on the go, you got to come to share it with them.

Though he coded a lot of nights, I usually got the futon at night. He had to code it at night because the server, when the internet was live, needed to be functional. And we just had data for the Bay Area at the time. So we were just kind of making sure that the people in the Bay Area could use it.\nAnd then I had a little mini-fridge with a cooking stove on it, and we cooked simple things, you know, like pasta sauce and pasta and things like that. That would be as cheap as dirt. People think it’s expensive to eat real food. It is actually really cheap to cook some vegetables, pasta, and beans – it’s super cheap. And then we would go eat at Jack in the Box, which I can still… I still kind of shiver a little.

We were doing a seed round, an angel round, and doing our best to talk to everyone and anyone we could find.\nWe had a very good friend with us, Greg Curry, who’s now passed away, who was older than us by about ten years, I think. He was a wonderful mentor who helped us out and put a little money in as well. And then I did a lot of the work to just network with people. I think our first salesman who was selling Yellow Pages ads for us, he was a real estate agent who knew another person who knew this other person who helped us raise… put together – we ended up not doing the round – but put together around $200,000 or something.

If you had instant payment, you improve transaction velocity dramatically like a factor of maybe three to five."

    {
      "role": "kimbal",
      "text": "Yeah. I’ve just sort of seen that when an industry is disrupted, that you’ve worried about the major players. I mean, when we started Tesla we were aspiring to be the GM of the 21st century. Four years later GM went bankrupt. You’re like, “Okay, we don’t want to be you.” And it’s, you know, whoever is going to be the main competitors – we don’t know yet – but it may not be the entrenched players. It may be sort of other companies.\nAnd so that happened at Zip2 where we tried our best to partner with the industry, because that seemed like the best way to make some money and actually have a revenue model. And we ended up finding the newspapers to be a better partner because they didn’t have the Yellow Pages business. And they I think were smarter; their classifies business was getting eaten away by Craigslist. You know, before Craigslist, classifies was the bread and butter of the newspaper. And of course, anyone who used Craigslist would never use the newspapers.\nSo it was those folks seem to have a better – at least some of the players – had more vision of the future. And so our business became putting the major newspapers, New York Times to all of the, you know, Philadelphia Inquirer, Chicago Tribune, or whatever, all the main players, all… the LA Times, everyone.\nAnd then we started going internationally doing the same thing. So if you went on to the New York Times website, and you wanted to search for a restaurant, of course, they have all these reviews, or if you wanted to search for a home, we tied the MLS together with maps and door-to-door directions. So all of these services that we now use and take for granted that use maps and door-to-door directions, we did that all in the 90s to find a business model."

      "text": "Alright, so I’mgonna recall things that are (… 1:21:57) quite a while. So it would have been like ’98 when Compaq offered to acquire Zip2, which I think it was a good thing Zip2 got acquired because, as I mentioned, the newspapers or actually the media companies had too much control over Zip2. So they were not… we had great technology that was not being deployed effectively. And they’re just generally averse to anything that could remotely be competitive with their newspapers. So, we’re sort of trapped in this situation. And the bidding of Compaq came along, and they bought the company in late ‘98, and the deal closed early ‘99. So, as a result, that came out, I had some capital – $20 million or something out of it.\nI think the thing that was frustrating to me was that we’d built incredible technology, and it had not been used. That was just sort of very disappointing. You know, put a lot of work into this technology, and it just wasn’t being used. So I was like, “Okay, I want to do one more thing on the internet, just to show that we can make technology that is… when it’s used properly, can be extremely effective. So I thought about what’s digital, essentially. What exists in the form of information and is also not high bandwidth? Because in ‘99, people still mostly had modems. So you couldn’t… like video was not really feasible in ‘99.\nSo with money is low bandwidth, and digital, effectively, mostly digital. So it’s like, what can we do to make money work better? Like money, in my view, is essentially an information system for labor allocation. It hasn’t power in and of itself. It’s like a database for guiding people to what they should do. And so you can think of banks as a set of heterogeneous databases with… that they’re actually not very secure. And certainly, the monetary system, the transport system of checks is very insecure, still is insecure, so are credit cards. And it’s still and mostly bad processing; it was entirely bad processing that they said was not.\nSo payments were, or money was like heterogeneous, high latency, low security collection of databases. That’s what banks are. And so, just from an information theory standpoint, this should be something that can be much better if it can be real-time, secure, and, you know, just very fast. Essentially, it’s just one real-time database. So it’s like, “Okay, let’s try to build that.” So that’s what X.com was. And then, at that time, I also thought we should try to just do all the financial things as well – not just payments. I still think that’s really what PayPal should have done, but whatever, it’s water under the bridge at this point.\nAnd then, there was a company that was formed around the same time called Confinity, which was Peter Thiel and Max Levchin, and Luke Nosek, David Sacks, Ken Howery,  and (… 1:25:55). And at X.com, there’s also like Jeremy Stoppelman, who created Yelp, Roelof Botha, who then went on to run Sequoia and found YouTube. That was X.com. So we just had these two companies with a crazy amount of talent – X.com and Confinity. Confinity started as a PalmPilot cryptography company back when you could communicate via the infrared port of a PalmPilot. So it was like, you’d basically communicate crypto tokens between PalmPilots using the infrared port and then reconcile them on a PC.\nNow obviously, that’s, they evolved to go in the payments direction as well. And we were both in Palo Alto, we’re like, literally a block away from each other. I think at one point, we’re briefly even in the same building. So we were just competing with each other like maniacs. And then we had a coffee on University Avenue and said, “Hey, why don’t we just combine our efforts, or we’re just gonna bludgeon each other to death here?” So we merged Confinity and X.com and raised $100 million in the space of three weeks in March of 2000. And in April, the market went into freefall."

The company was called X.com for about a year. And then, we change the company name to the product name. The product was PayPal. (… 1:28:22)"

And as soon as they transfer money out of the system, the efficiency of the database drops dramatically because now you’re in the traditional banking world.\nSo if you just offer all the things that… – if you just basically address all the reasons why people are taking money out of the PayPal system, so you have to provide them with checks so that you have a bridge to the legacy transaction system, you have to provide them with a debit card, provide them with the ability to get a loan and that kind of thing. But these are all ancillary to accelerating the velocity and accuracy and security of payments. Then, basically, PayPal would be where all the money is. It would just suck all the money out of the banks, and the banks would go away."
