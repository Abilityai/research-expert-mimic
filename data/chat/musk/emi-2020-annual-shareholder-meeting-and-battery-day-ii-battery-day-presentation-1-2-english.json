It’s incredibly important that we accelerate the advent of sustainable energy. Time really matters. This presentation is about accelerating the time to sustainable energy. The past five years were the hottest on record. We have what looks like a wall for CO2 ppm. It’s obviously… This time is not like the past.  It’s really important that we take action.

      "text": "Yeah. So anyway, there is a lot of good news, though. A lot of people may not be aware that wind and solar comprise 75% of new electricity capacity in the US this year. So, this is really major. The grid is going sustainable very quickly. Now, it’s also worth noting that the length of time that power plants last is on the order of 25 years. So even if 100% of energy generation was sustainable, it will still take 25 years to convert the grid. And it’s also worth noting that in the past ten years, power production from coal has dropped in half. It went from 46% of electricity in 2010 to 23% in 2020. This is a massive improvement. So, good things are happening on a lot of levels. We just need to go faster.\nSo, Tesla’s contribution: we’ve delivered over a million electric vehicles, 26 billion electric miles driven, and many gigawatt-hours\n(GWh)\nof stationary batteries, 17 terawatt-hours\n(TWh)\nof solar-generated. I think solar is sometimes underweighted at Tesla, but it is a massive part of our future. The three parts of a sustainable energy future are sustainable energy generation, storage, and electric vehicles. We intend to play a significant role in all three.\nTo accelerate the transition to sustainable energy, we must produce more EVs that need to be affordable and a lot more energy storage while building factories faster and with far less investment.\nSo, goal number one is a terawatt-hour scale battery production. So, Tera is the new Giga. And a terawatt is a thousand times more than a gigawatt. We used to talk in terms of gigawatts, in the future, we’ll be talking in terms of terawatt-hours. This is what’s needed in order to transition the world to sustainability."

    {
      "role": "elon_musk",
      "text": "Yeah, and I think we should view this as more than just a question of money. Money is sort of an material thing,  but it’s really the amount of effort. You have a certain amount of effort in terms of people and machines, and depending on how efficient that effort is, for a given amount of effort, you want the most amount of batteries. It’s not just the question of, well, if we have $2 trillion, tomorrow you could make this. It’s not that easy. You actually need to organize a massive number of people, build a lot of machines, build the machines that make the machines. And so it’s incredibly important to have that effort yield the most number of batteries.\nAnd then goal two: obviously we need to make more affordable cars. I think one of the things that troubles me the most is that we don’t yet have a truly affordable car, and that is something that we will make in the future. But in order to do that, we’ve got to get the cost of batteries down, and we’ve got to be better at manufacturing. And we need to do something about this curve. The curve of the cost per kilowatt-hour of batteries is not improving fast enough. We’ve given this a lot of thought over many years to say, okay, how can we radically improve the cost per kilowatt-hour curve? It’s been somewhat flattening out actually in recent years."

It’s a plan that has taken creative engineering and industrialization across every facet of what makes a cell into a battery pack, from raw material to the finished thing. And we’re going to go through that plan with you today, step-by-step, and build up how we get to these goals and how we accelerate this transition and make our vehicles and our grid batteries more affordable."

    },
    {
      "role": "drew_baglino",
      "text": "Yes. So first, before we get too far into it, let’s talk about what is in a battery cell. We’ve got the cap and the can, negative and positive terminals of the cell. When you open that cell, you’ve got a tab connected to those terminals, what we call the jelly roll, which is the wound electrodes on the inside. You can actually see what this looks like as you unwind it. This is over a meter long in a typical 2170 cell. So, it’s quite a long winding process. And you can see the tab still there. And then to explain what’s actually going on here, we’ve identified, we’ve got anode, cathode, separator, positive and negative terminal.\nWatch what happens as we – there we go – discharge the cell. Got lithium moving from anode to cathode. And then the reverse, when we charge the cell, lithium moving from cathode to anode across the separator. This is the basic of what makes all lithium-ion batteries, no matter what the form factor is.\nAnd when we look at what’s happened today, at least in our products, we’ve moved from the 18650 form factor to the 2170 form factor through great collaboration with our partners, Panasonic, new partners like LG and CATL, and probably others in the future."
    },
    {
      "role": "elon_musk",
      "text": "Actually, slight note on why is the one called 18650, although not on the slide, versus the 2170, is that the first two digits refer to the diameter, and the second two digits refer to the length. So that helps explain what’s up with these weird numbers. But nobody could explain to me why there was an extra zero.  So I, so I said, “Okay, well, we’re deleting the zero that nobody can explain in future form factors.” So that’s why it’s technically, it’s like the 18650 bizarrely, but going forward, it’s the 2170 because we just got rid of the extra zero because it’s pointless."

    {
      "role": "drew_baglino",
      "text": "And this was an evolutionary step going from 1865 to 2170, bringing 50% more energy into the cell. But when we look to the ideal cell design, if we were to do it ourselves, we need to go beyond just what we’re looking at us in front of us and study the full spectrum of options. As you can see, we kind of swept the key figures of merit, how much we can reduce the cost and how much vehicle range increases as we change the outer diameter of the cell. We found a sweet spot somewhere around 46 millimeters. But it’s not just about a bigger form factor. Anybody could make a bigger form factor."

      "text": "Yeah, exactly. There are problems as you make cells larger. In fact, supercharging and thermals in general, become really challenging as you make bigger cells. And this was the challenge that our team set our sights on to overcome. And we did; we came up with this tabless architecture that maybe you’ve heard about, that basically removes the thermal problem from the equation and allows us to go to the absolute lowest cost form factor and the simplest manufacturing process.\nAnd this is what we mean when we talk about tabless. It’s kind of a beautiful thing."

You actually have a shorter path length in a large tabless cell than you have in the smaller cell with tabs. This is a big deal. So even though the cell is bigger, it actually has more power. The power to weight ratio is actually better than the smaller cell with tabs.\nThis is, again, this is quite hard to do. Nobody’s done it before, and it really took a tremendous amount of effort within Tesla Engineering to figure out how do we make a frigging tabless cell and have it actually work and then connect that to the top cap. There’s a whole bunch of things that we’re keeping a little secret sauce here that we’re not telling everything, but…"

So anyway, there’s a lot of really cool things going on that enable tabless. And it was really due to a really great engineering team. Drew and the rest of the team had done amazing work in achieving this tabless construction. I think it may sort of sound a bit silly to some people, but for people that really know cells, this is a massive breakthrough."

      "role": "elon_musk",
      "text": "Yeah. Just to elaborate on that a bit, it’s like when the cell is going through the system, it has to keep stopping where all the tabs are. You can’t do a continuous motion production if you have tabs. You have to keep stopping, and then there’s a rate at which you can start and stop and accelerate again, and it really slows down the rate of production. And then sometimes you get the tabs wrong, and you also lose a little bit of active area. It’s really a huge pain in the ass to have tabs from a production standpoint."

And just to clarify, when we see these plus 16% or whatever the percentage rate increase is,  these are the amounts due just to that particular innovation. We’ll list a whole bunch of innovations, and then when you add them up, you get a total improvement in energy density and cost. But these numbers are what refer to just this thing."

    {
      "role": "elon_musk",
      "text": "Yeah. So. Yeah. It’s a video of some of what’s going on in the plant. Now. I mean, to be clear, it will take about a year to reach the 10 GWh capacity. This is important to appreciate. When you build a factory, there’s a certain capacity that you design to, and then it takes some period of time to actually achieve that capacity. I would say it’s probably about a year before we get to the 10 GWh annualized rate with the pilot plant. And this is just a pilot plant. The actual production plants will be more on the order of maybe 200 GWh, maybe more over time."
    },
    {
      "role": "drew_baglino",
      "text": "But let’s stack up everything we just saw at the cell level. So just the cell form factor change enables a 14% $/kWh reduction, just that cell form factor change. And now that you’ve been teased on this factory, we’re going to go on and walk step-by-step through that factory and discuss a series of innovations there.\nWhen thinking about the ideal cell factory, we have inspirations behind us in the paper and bottling industry, wherefrom humble beginnings, over a century of innovation has enabled mass scale, continuous motion, unbelievably low manufacturing costs. And when we think about the lithium-ion industry, which is really only in its third decade of high-volume production, it has so far to go to achieve similar scale and simplicity. And that was the inspiration that we set out to the team as we thought about how to marry cell design and manufacturing in the best possible factory.\nAnd let’s talk a little bit about what’s in a cell factory. First, there’s an electrode process where the active materials are coated into films onto foils. Then those coated foils are wound in the winding process we just talked about where if you do have tabs, you have to start and stop a lot. Then the jelly roll is assembled into the can, sealed, filled with electrolyte, and then sent to formation where the cell is charged for the first time and where the sort of the electrochemistry is set and the quality of the cell is verified.\nAnd we set out at every step of this process to try to take that inspiration we just showed and think about how we make those processes fundamentally better and more scalable. And one of the most important processes is where it all begins, the wet process of the electrode coding. And just to give you all a sense of scale, I’m going to walk through what’s in that wet process.\nYou’ve got mixing where the powders are mixed with either a water or a solvent, solvents for the cathode. That mix then goes into a large coat and dry oven where the slurry is coated onto the foil, huge ovens, tens of meters long, dried, and that solvent then has to be recovered. You can see the solvent recovery system. And then, finally, the coated foil is compressed to the final density. And when you’re looking at this, you’re like, wow, that’s a lot of equipment for one step, especially when you consider that little spec next to the coating oven is a person. This is serious iron involved in making batteries.\nWouldn’t it be great if we could skip that solvent step, which is one of those dig a ditch, and then fill it kind of things where you put the solvent in and then take it out and recycle it, and just go straight to a dry mix to coat? And that’s what the dry process really is about. And in the most basic form, you can see it here on a benchtop, literally powder into film, as simple as that."

    {
      "role": "elon_musk",
      "text": "I mean, it’s hard actually, just to be clear. If this was easy, everyone would do it. It’s not like dry coating electrode is actually easy. It’s actually very hard to do  what appears to be a simple thing. And it’s worth noting, we did acquire Maxwell a little over a year ago, I guess, and certainly a good company and everything. But the dry coating they had was like, it’s like a sort of, I would call proof of concept.\nSince the acquisition, we’ve actually ramped the machine that does dry coating four times, so a revision full post acquisition of the machine. And there’s still a lot of work to do. So I would not say this is completely in the bag. It’s still a lot of work to do. And as you grow, as you scale, go from benchtop to lab to pilot to volume production, there are actually major issues that you encounter at every level. It’s not like you make something work on your bench and bingo, now you can make a bazillion of it."

I think it’s actually quite a lot like the rocket equation where you’ve got basically the rocket equation – you’ve got your exhaust velocity and then the log of the start and end masses. It’s basically saying how fast are things going and what percentage of the factory volume is doing useful work? And conveyance does not count as useful work."

If you break the factory down into cubic meter sections and say – or smaller, could be like one-liter sections – and say, “Is a majority of this volume doing useful work?” You’d be astounded at how bad most factories are. They’d be like maybe 2 or 3%, including our factory in Fremont. I think it’s possible to get to at least ten times that of volumetric efficiency. More like 30%ish, maybe more, and be 10x better, which means the factory can be ten times smaller.\nAnd then the other thing is how fast are things going through the factory? It’s like speed and density. A factory that’s moving at, say, twice the speed of another factory is equivalent to two factories, basically. And the company that will be successful is the company that with one factory can accomplish what other companies take two or three or four factories to do. This is what we’re trying to do here is say, okay, how do we  with one factory achieve what maybe five or even ten factories would normally be required to achieve?"

In our car, we charge thousands of cells at once.

It’s just basically four times better than the current state of the art to the best of our knowledge. And I think there’s probably room to improve even beyond that."

You can see basically we can get a terawatt-hour in less space than it took to make a gigawatt-hour, you know, 150 GWh. This is pretty profound. I would actually not have thought this was possible several years ago, that we could actually get to a TWh scale in less space than what we currently envisioned for doing 150 GWh."

And this is a 100 GWh supplemental to what we buy from suppliers. And yeah, essentially, this does reduce our weighted average cost of a cell, but it allows us to make a lot more cars and a lot more stationary storage. And then, long-term, we’re expecting to make on the order of 3,000  GWh or 3 TWh per year. I think we’ve got a good chance of achieving this actually before 2030, but I’m highly confident that we could do it by 2030."
