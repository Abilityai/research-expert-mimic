Just the word ‘radiation’ sounds scary. They can’t calibrate what radiation means. But radiation is much less dangerous than you think. For example, Fukushima – when the Fukushima problem happened due to the tsunami… I got people in California asking me if they should worry about radiation from Fukushima. And I’m like, “Definitely not. Not even slightly, not at all. That is crazy.” And just to show that the danger is so much overplayed compared to what it really is, I actually flew to Fukushima. And actually, I donated a solar power system for a water treatment plant. And I made a point of eating locally grown vegetables on TV in Fukushima. Like, I’m still alive, okay."

Like I said, you got to look at these things in the context of the history at the time and say, “What were the alternatives, and what are you comparing it against?”\nAnd I do not think it will be the case that Britain would get a bad grade when looking at history at the time. Now, if you judge history from what is morally acceptable today, you basically are going to give everyone a failing grade. I don’t think anyone would get a passing grade in their morality.

You always can skip subjects, so you read a few paragraphs, and you know you’re not interested, just jump to the next one. So read the encyclopedia or skim through it.\nI put a lot of stock and certainly have a lot of respect for someone who puts in an honest day’s work to do useful things. And just generally, to have not a zero-sum mindset, or have more of a grow the pie mindset. If you sort of say, like, when I see people, perhaps including some very smart people, kind of taking an attitude of doing things that seem morally questionable, it’s often because they have, at a base sort of axiomatic level, a zero-sum mindset without realizing it. They don’t realize they have a zero-sum mindset, or at least they don’t realize it consciously.\nAnd so, if you have a zero-sum mindset, then the only way to get ahead is by taking things from others. If the pie is fixed, then the only way to have more pie is to take someone else’s pie. But this is false. Obviously, the pie has grown dramatically over time – the economic pie. In reality, you can have – overuse this analogy – there’s a lot of pie. Pie is not fixed. So you really want to make sure you’re not operating without realizing it from a zero-sum mindset, where the only way to get ahead is to take things from others, then that’s going to result in you to try to take things from others, which is not good. It’s much better to work on adding to the economic pie, you know, creating more than you consume, doing more than you… Yeah. That’s a big deal. I think there’s a fair number of people in finance that do have a bit of a zero-sum mindset."

What happens when you celebrate others, and you promote others, the ideas of others – it actually grows that pie. The resources become less scarce. And that applies in a lot of kinds of domains. That applies in academia, where a lot of people see some funding for academic research as zero-sum. It is not. If you celebrate each other, if you get everybody to be excited about AI, about physics, about mathematics, I think there’ll be more and more funding, and I think everybody wins.

I just wonder if you think about that kind of thing when you talk about preserving the light of human consciousness and us becoming a multiplanetary species.\nI mean, to me at least, that means, like, if we’re just alone and conscious and intelligent, it doesn’t mean nearly as much as if we’re with others. Right? And there’s some magic created when we’re together – the friendship of it. And I think the highest form of it is love, which I think broadly is much bigger than just sort of romantic.

And if you can properly frame the question, then the answer, relatively speaking, is easy.
