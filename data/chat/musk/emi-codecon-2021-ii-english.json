Or with the rockets. So, you have these big defense contracts that you’re doing, correct? The first time someone’s broken into the area. How do you meet those criticisms? Is this just small potatoes?"

I believe at this point, they are satisfied that they will not. We take great pains to ensure that the satellites do not reflect or otherwise interfere with the telescopes, including the most sensitive telescopes. There may be a few sort of amateur astronomers who aren’t happy. But the professional ones are satisfied that we’re taking reasonable steps to ensure that we are not standing in the way of science, nor would we ever want to.\nAnd we’re also looking at launching some new telescopes using Starship. Because Starship’s much bigger vehicle, we can launch satellites that have 10 times the resolution of the Hubble, which would be great for science. And, in fact, there’s an exciting program, working with Saul Perlmutter at Berkeley, on a big new Space telescope. And I think we’ll do more of those. I think at the end of the day, Starship and SpaceX are gonna do a lot to advance our understanding of astrophysics and astronomy."

If the resupply ships from Earth stop coming for any reason, whether that is civilization on Earth, it could be a mundane reason or could be World War III – but does Mars prosper or die out?\nAnd if Mars is missing anything at all, like the civilizational equivalent of vitamin C, then it will eventually die out. So you need to get to the point where a Mars city is self-sustaining, even if the ships from Earth stop coming. Then you have passed the great filter or at least passed particularly that great filter. I think we should endeavor to pass that great filter as soon as possible."

So, that’s our primary mission.\nI mean, there are many good causes in the world, but we got to be careful that we do not try to take on too many. I mean, there are many noble missions, but we have to pick our battles and say, “Okay, let’s just make sure we get this done,” because nobody else is doing it. I mean, if SpaceX doesn’t do it, I’m not sure how it will happen. I think, at the least right now, SpaceX is the only hope. So we are going to get this done. And it’s far from done. I mean, we’ve got a long way to go.\nStarlink, in terms of providing internet connectivity to people that really don’t have it or it’s very expensive, I think will be helpful in empowering a lot of people who are disempowered today. I think that’s a good thing, too."

So, you know, after the population collapse issue, I think AI safety is probably the second biggest threat to the future of civilization. And yeah, like I said, I’m not quite sure what to do with it.\nTesla is arguably the world’s biggest robot maker because like we have basically semi-autonomous cars that will ultimately be fully autonomous. And we are building a humanoid robot that will be basically like the car but with legs. I kind of held off on doing that for a while because, you know, I certainly don’t want to hasten the AI apocalypse. But clearly, if you look at Boston Dynamics, these humanoid robots are gonna happen. So they’re gonna happen with or without Tesla. So it’s like, Tesla’s got a little bit more, I mean, a lot more ability to ensure robotics safety and AI. And I will try my best to do that."

Anyway, really, really quick: Look, we’re living in this in-between time between we drive our cars, ourselves, and the cars drive themselves. They’re semi-autonomous. For those of us in the industry, those of us who understand something about technology, about machine learning, I actually like it; it’s pretty easy. It fixes my mistakes. I fix its mistakes.\nA lot in the press, though, about it, and Google’s position certainly is, this is like the worst place to be. Right? Because people are going to get checked out in the cars, are going to drive themselves into… What do you think about the ML\n(machine learning)\nhuman hybrids that we’re kind of, you know, embracing right now? How long are we going to have these crossover periods? I know you believe FSD is around the corner. Do you think this is really a problem, or we’re going to teach people to deal with ML?"

But I think we published the safety stats, like basically miles driven on autopilot and miles driven manually. And this, I mean, it’s an order of magnitude different. So like, people would say, “Oh well, you’re playing with the statistics,” I’m like, “Listen, we’re just saying, miles driven autopilot, miles not driven autopilot,” and there’s a factor 10 difference. So I mean, even if we were like… we’re not fiddling with the statistics. This is not subtle. That is what I’m saying. It’s not subtle.\nThe truth is that people are actually not great at driving these two-ton death machines, you know. And people get tired, and they get drunk, and they get distracted, and they text, and they do all sorts of things they shouldn’t do. And then the cars crash, basically. When we’re embarking on the autonomy front, someone told me, I think that’s quite true, which is, even if you, for argument’s sake, reduce fatalities by 90% with autonomy, the 10% that do die with autonomy are still going to sue you. The 90% that are living don’t even know that that’s the reason they’re alive.\nNonetheless, I’ve had many conversations with the Tesla autopilot full self-driving team, who are just an outstanding group of people. And saying, like, listen, guys, it is better to pursue… – Like, the reality of doing the right thing matters more than the perception of doing the right thing. As long as we are confident that we’re doing the right thing, even if we are criticized and sued and all that, we should nonetheless do the right thing and not care about simply the perception of the right thing."

As we move towards more green energy utilities, are getting rid of their fossil plants, coal plants, investing in renewables, there’s a difference in economic output they can deliver. Are you concerned at all as the growth of EVs continues? Do you think we could have a supply chain problem with energy down the road?"
    },
    {
      "role": "elon_musk",
      "text": "Yeah, I think that’s a very good question. The full answer is lengthy. I’ll try to give you the short version. The electricity demand, roughly… if we shift our transport to electric, then electricity demand approximately doubles, maybe a little more than doubles. And this is going to create a lot of challenges with the grid, especially for distribution to neighborhoods.\nAnd this is why Tesla has the product, the solar roof and solar retrofit – is because even if you increase sustainable power generation at the utility level, you’re still gonna have a distribution problem where you need new high-power lines, new medium-power lines, you need to dramatically increase the size of the substations, which means you’re gonna have to start locking down houses to increase the substation size. This is really unworkable unless you have significant local power generation at houses. And this is why I think it’s actually very important that a necessary part of the solution is local power generation, on roofs, on the houses of homes – very important.\nAnd then, of course, we need large, sustainable power generation developments, primarily wind and solar. But it needs to be paired with battery packs for steady-state so it can provide continuous power. And a lot of good things are happening in this regard. The growth of solar in the last several years has been incredible. I think it’s like a 40% compound annual growth rate in solar, and also a big growth in wind.\nI’m also kind of pro-nuclear, and I’m sort of surprised by a lot of the public sentiment against nuclear. I’m not saying we should go build a whole bunch of new nuclear plants, but I don’t think we should shut down ones that are operating safely. They did this in Germany, for example, and then had to create a whole bunch of coal power plants. And I don’t think that was the right decision, frankly. Yeah, anyway, so one or another, though, we’re going to have to have a lot more electricity generation. And this is primarily going to come down to solar and wind paired with batteries."
