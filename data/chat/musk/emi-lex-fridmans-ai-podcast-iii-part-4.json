If we don’t do this, the system will not work properly. So, the work of the engineers doing this, they are like the unsung heroes. But they are critical to the success of the situation."

It takes humans such a long time to even label one video clip, like several hours.

From a fan of robotics, I think the elegance of movement that the humanoid robots, that bipedal robots show are just so cool. So it’s really interesting that you’re working on this, and also talking about applying the same kind of all the ideas of some of which you’ve talked about with data engine and all the things that we’re talking about with Tesla Autopilot, just transferring that over to the just yet another robotics problem.\nI have to ask since I care about human-robot interaction, so the human side of that. So you’ve talked about mostly in the factory. Do you see as part of this problem that Tesla Bot has to solve is interacting with humans and potentially having a place like in the home? So, interacting, not just replacing labor but also like, I don’t know, being a friend or an assistant?"
    },
    {
      "role": "elon_musk",
      "text": "I think the possibilities are endless. Yeah, I mean, it’s obviously, it’s not quite in Tesla’s primary mission direction of accelerating sustainable energy, but it is an extremely useful thing that we can do for the world, which is to make a useful humanoid robot that is capable of interacting with the world and helping in many different ways. So, in factories… I think if you say like, extrapolate to many years in the future, it’s like, I think, work will become optional.\nThere’s a lot of jobs that if people weren’t paid to do it, they wouldn’t do it. It’s not fun necessarily if you’re washing dishes all day – it’s like, even if you really like washing dishes, do you really want to do it for eight hours a day, every day? Probably not. And then there’s dangerous work. Basically, if it’s dangerous, boring, has potential for repetitive stress or injury, that kind of thing, then that’s really where humanoid robots would add the most value initially. So, that’s what we’re aiming for is for the humanoid robots to do jobs that people don’t voluntarily want to do. And then that will have to pair obviously with some kind of universal basic income in the future. So, I think.\nLex Fridman: (\n1:39:01) Do you see a world when there’s like hundreds of millions of Tesla Bots performing different tasks throughout the world?"

    },
    {
      "role": "elon_musk",
      "text": "Actually, it’s funny you ask this question because normally, I do try to think pretty far into the future. But I haven’t really thought that far into the future with the Tesla Bot or its codenamed Optimus. I call it Optimus Sub-Prime because it’s not like a giant transformer robot, but it’s meant to be a general-purpose help robot. Basically, Tesla, I think, has the most advanced real-world AI for interacting with real world which we’ve developed as a function to make self-driving work, and so, along with custom hardware and a lot of hardcore, low-level software to have it run efficiently and be power efficient.\nBecause, you know, it’s one thing to do neural nets, if you’ve got a gigantic server room with 10,000 computers. But now, you have to now distill that down into one computer that’s running at low power in a humanoid robot or a car. That’s actually very difficult, and a lot of hardcore software work is required for that. So, since we’re kind of solving the ‘navigate the real world with neural nets’ problem for cars, which are kind of robots with four wheels, then it’s kind of a natural extension of that is to put it in a robot with arms and legs and actuators.\nThe two hard things are you basically need to make the… have the robot be intelligent enough to interact in a sensible way with the environment. So you need real-world AI, and you need to be very good at manufacturing, which is a very hard problem. Tesla is very good at manufacturing, and also has the real-world AI. So making the humanoid robot work is… basically it means developing custom motors and sensors that are different from what a car would use. I think we’ve got the best expertise in developing advanced electric motors and power electronics. So it just has to be for humanoid robot application, not a car."

It seems, there’s a huge amount of loneliness in this world. All of us seek companionship with other humans, friendship, and all those kinds of things. We have a lot of here in Austin, a lot of people have dogs. There seems to be a huge opportunity to also have robots that decrease the amount of loneliness in the world or help us humans connect with each other so in way that dogs can. Do you think about that with Tesla Bot at all? Or is it really focused on the problem of performing specific tasks? Not connecting with humans?"

And really, what matters is the pace of innovation and also access to high-quality fuel and raw materials.

That allowed the British and the Americans to design aircraft engines that were super high performance, better than anything else in the world.

But it’s just that wars tend to be written about a lot, whereas something being a normal year where nothing major happened doesn’t get written about much. But that’s, you know, most people just like farming and kind of like living their life, you know, being a villager somewhere. And every now and again, there’s a war.\nI have to say that there aren’t very many books that I… where I just had to stop reading because it was just too dark.

It’s almost like this kind of responsibility that all of us have to tend towards the good. And so, to me, looking at history is almost like an example of, look, you have some charismatic leader that convinces you of things is too easy, based on that story to do evil onto each other, onto your family and to others.\nSo it’s our responsibility to do good. It’s not like now is somehow different from history; that can happen again. All that can happen again. And yes, most of the time, you’re right.

It’s very low density, it’s a deep cryogen, so it’s only liquid very close to absolute zero, requires a lot of insulation. So it is a lot of challenges there.\nAnd I was actually reading a bit about Russian rocket engine development. And at least the impression I had was that Soviet Union, Russia and Ukraine, primarily, were actually in the process of switching to methane oxygen. And there are some interesting tests and data for I\nsp\nlike they were able to get up to a 380 second I\nsp\nwith the methane oxygen engine, and I was like, wow, okay, that’s actually really impressive. So I think you could actually get a much lower cost… like in optimizing cost per ton to orbit, cost per ton to Mars, I think methane oxygen is the way to go. And I was partly inspired by the Russian work on the test ends with methane oxygen engines."
