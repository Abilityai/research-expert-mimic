I’ve thought about this quite a lot.I guess, thinking about an electric plane is that you want to go as high as possible, but you need a certain energy density in the battery pack because you have to overcome gravitational potential energy. Once you’ve overcome gravitational potential energy, and you’re out at a high altitude, the energy use in cruise is very low.\nAnd then, you can recapture a large part of the gravitational potential energy on the way down. So, you really don’t need any kind of reserve fuel, if you will, because you have the energy of height, gravitational potential energy. This is a lot of energy.\nSo, once you can get high, like the way to think about a plane is it’s a force balance. So, the force balance — So, a plane that is not accelerating is a neutral force balance. You have the force of gravity, you have the lift force, you have the wings. Then, you’ve got the force of the whatever thrusting device, so the propeller, or turbine, or whatever it is. And you’ve got the resistance force of the air.\nNow, the higher you go, the lower the air resistance is.  Air density drops exponentially, but drag increases with the square, and exponential beats the square. The higher you go, the faster you will go for the same amount of energy. And at a certain altitude, you can go supersonic with less energy per mile, quite a lot less energy per mile than an aircraft at 35,000 feet because it’s just a force balance."

That’s why it matters whether electric cars happen sooner or later. You know, we’re really playing a crazy game here with the atmosphere and the oceans.\nWe’re taking vast amounts of carbon from deep underground and putting this in the atmosphere. This is crazy. We should not do this. It’s very dangerous. So, we should accelerate the transition to sustainable energy. I mean, the bizarre thing is that, obviously, we’re going to run out of oil in the long term. You know, we’re going to — There’s only so much oil we can mine and burn. It’s totally logical.  We must have a sustainable energy transport and energy infrastructure in the long term.\nSo, we know that’s the endpoint. We know that.

We can probably even add some more, but the momentum towards sustainable energy is too slow.\nLike there’s a vast base of industry, vast transportation system. Like there’s two and a half billion cars and trucks in the world. And the new car and truck production,  if it was a 100% electric, that’s only about 100 million per year. So, it would take — If you could snap your fingers and instantly turn all cars and trucks electric, it would still take 25 years to change the transport base to electric.

      "role": "elon_musk",
      "text": "Well, the thing that is going on right now is that there is an inherent subsidy in any oil-burning device. Any power plant or car is fundamentally consuming the carbon capacity of the oceans and atmosphere, or just say atmosphere for short. So, like, you can say, okay, there’s a certain probability of something bad happening past a certain carbon concentration in the atmosphere.\nAnd so, there’s some uncertain number where if we put too much carbon into the atmosphere, things overheat, oceans warm up, ice caps melt, ocean real estate becomes a lot less valuable, you know, if something’s underwater, but it’s not clear what that number is. But, definitely, scientists, it’s really quite — The scientific consensus is overwhelming. Overwhelming.\nI mean, I don’t know any serious scientist, actually zero, literally zero who don’t think, you know, that we have quite a serious climate risk that we’re facing. And so, there’s fundamentally a subsidy occurring with every fossil fuel burning thing, power plants, aircraft, car, frankly even rockets. I mean, rockets use up — you know, they burn. They burn fuel. But there’s just — you know, with rockets, there’s just no other way to get to orbit, unfortunately. So, it’s the only way.\nBut with cars, there’s definitely a better way with electric cars.  And to generate the energy, do so with photovoltaics because we’ve got a giant nuclear reactor in the sky called the sun. It’s great. It sort of shows up every day, very reliable. So, if you can generate energy from solar panels stored up with batteries, you can have energy 24 hours a day.\nAnd then, you know, you can send to the poles or near to the north with, you know, high voltage lines. Most of the northern parts of the world tend to have a lot of hydropower as well. But, anyway, all fossil fuel-powered things have an inherent subsidy, which is their consumption of the carbon capacity of the atmosphere and oceans.\nSo, people tend to think like why should electric vehicles have a subsidy, but they’re not taking into account that all fossil fuel-burning vehicles fundamentally are subsidized by the cost, the environmental cost to Earth, but nobody’s paying for it. We are going to pay for it, obviously. In the future, we’ll pay for it. It’s just not paid for now."
