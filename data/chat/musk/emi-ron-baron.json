In the case of Tesla, I think it’s fair to say that Tesla has significantly accelerated the advent of sustainable energy. Before Tesla, no one was doing electric cars. And now, as a result of Tesla, I think almost every major car company in the world is building electric cars, and I think that’s a pretty big deal. But there’s still a long way to go to transition the world to a sustainable energy economy. And so we still have a lot of work ahead of us at Tesla, but that’s our goal there.\nAnd then, for SpaceX, it’s important for the future to be exciting. And for humanity‘s existence to be assured of in the long term, I think we must become a multi-planet species and a spacefaring civilization. We’re here like four and a half billion years after Earth got started, 13.8 billion years into the age of the universe. And it’s only now recently, in the last 5,000 years, that we even invented writing. I would say, date the first civilization by when there was the first writing, which was in ancient Sumer around five or six thousand years ago. So, we’ve basically just been here for a very brief instant."

So when you started SpaceX, you didn’t think about satellites. When you started Tesla, you didn’t think about robots; when you don’t have enough people, you didn’t think about robots. And so you didn’t think about autonomous driving. And without Elon, there would not be electric cars. Nobody who makes cars wants to make electric cars. They’re being forced to make them. In fact, every time they sell electric cars, they sell one fewer car that they make money on. They have all that money invested in plants to make those other cars. So nobody wants to have these cars except for him. And everybody thought it was going to fail. One of the things you said is that patents are for the weak. And you share your patents with other companies. Of course, on the other hand, when they get your patents, you’re two or three years ahead of them.\nThere are definitely roles for patents. In the case of Tesla, our goal is to advance sustainable energy, and we can’t just do it by ourselves. We need the whole industry to go that way, so we gave them our patents for free.\nElon Musk"

I think there is a role for patents. Let’s say if some company has spent a lot of money developing a particular medicine and had to go through expensive stage three medical trials, and then they finally get some medicine that is approved, but where the drug itself is cheap to manufacture, then I think a patent, in that case, makes sense. Otherwise, no one would go to the trouble of doing stage three medical trials. So there are definitely roles for patents. In the case of Tesla, our goal is to advance sustainable energy, and we can’t just do it by ourselves. We need the whole industry to go that way, so we gave them our patents for free in order to help them accelerate electric vehicles."

So we invest $7 billion, and we make $15 billion a year. I’m sorry, $15 million a year on a $7 million investment. Shocking. So no one else does that.

But we do expect to make cars that are more affordable than the current Model 3 or Model Y. I think, by far, the biggest factor is autonomy in terms of value of the car because right now, cars get driven for about 10 or 12 hours a week, like maybe one and a half hours a day. But there are 168 hours in a week. And so, if they were autonomous, the cars could drive for 50 or 60 hours, so we’d see a five-fold increase in the utility of the car that could be autonomy. This is a really gigantic thing. It would also mean that we wouldn’t need anywhere near as many parking lots. And this would also be helpful for the environment because you would need far fewer cars."

So you invest 7 billion, and you make $15 billion dollars a year. Who does that? And for a plant that makes things, manufacturing. And so the way this is accomplished is… so you’re doing it with casting right now. Casting half of the car and soon cast the other half of the car. And other companies – why don’t they try? Why don’t they try to do what we’re doing? In fact, one of the executives of another automobile company wanted me to introduce her to you. And you did that once in a meeting and now she wants to come visit with her Director of Engineering the plant in Austin. And I presume when I asked you, you’re going to say: “Yeah, bring her on.” Because you innovate so fast, by the time anyone copies what we’re doing, we’re on to something else. When you’re casting, what else is there that enables us to make it cheaper? We eliminated a lot of other parts, we eliminated functions. What are we doing to do that? How would we sell a car that’s so cheap?"

The first thing that you should do is make the requirements that you’ve been given less dumb. Whatever constraints and requirements you were given, they were, to some degree, dumb, and you want to make them less dumb. If you don’t start with this, then you get the right answer to the wrong question. And the requirements must be given from a person who can explain the requirements, not from a department, because then you don’t know who to talk to. Then step two is to delete the part or delete the process step.  This sounds extremely obvious, and yet, over and over again, we have found that parts were not needed, they were put in there, just in case, or by mistake. Or there was a step that someone thought was needed but was not actually needed. This sounds insanely obvious, but we have deleted so many parts from the car that did nothing."

      "text": "Well, yeah, I mean, I can give you so many examples. One example was, there were three fiberglass mats, on top of the battery pack. They partially covered the battery pack. I was on the battery pack production line, and the number one thing choking battery pack production was gluing on these three fiberglass mats to the top of the battery pack. So the reason I repeat this algorithm is because myself first did things backwards. First, I tried to automate it, then I tried to accelerate it, just go faster, then I tried to simplify it, and only then did I delete it. Because it turned out that the team at Tesla that does noise and vibration minimization, so making the car quiet, thought that the fiberglass mats were there because of the battery safety team for battery fire prevention. And then I asked the battery fire prevention team what they were needed for, and they said, “Oh, noise and vibration.” And I’m like, “Okay!” So then we had two cars drive, with a microphone in each car, and you could not tell the difference. So, we went to all that trouble for a part that should not exist.\nAnd then another example was, there was… these were chokepoints in the entire production system. That’s why they, you know… I’m running around the production line, trying to fix the production line, just like a maniac, like a Tasmanian devil, just running around the factory, like a lunatic. And let’s see… the body production line for Model 3 was at one point stuck because we had a laser welding cell to weld a small cross-car beam in the passenger footwell of the front seats. And I’m looking at this beam, and I’m like, “What the heck does that do?“ Because the entire factory is stopped trying to get this laser weld cell to work. And I’m like, “I can’t imagine what a useful thing it could do.” And the production team said, “Oh, that’s for crash safety.” So then I called the crash safety team, and I said, “Is this for crash safety?” And they said, “Oh no, this didn’t do anything, we should delete it.” It turned out to be totally useless. They forgot to tell the production team! So honestly, a bunch of these things just feel like you’re living in a Dilbert cartoon. I mean, at any given company, you should ask, “What’s your Dilbert ratio?” Okay. It’s not zero. The Dilbert quotient – try to keep it low."

And if that doesn’t happen, it blows up.” And I say, “Well, how does Elon know this?” Because you hire these great people, and then you ask them all these questions, and then somehow you remember everything I tell you.

It’s actually quite rare for me to give a talk and my day-to-day work at SpaceX and Tesla is almost entirely engineering and design. And also Production. Production is key. But although I consider that to be part of engineering.\nStarship is something special. The thing that’s the Holy Grail, like the critical breakthrough needed to make life multi-planetary and for humanity to be a spacefaring civilization, is a fully and rapidly reusable orbital rocket. We’ve gone most of the way there with Falcon 9. You may have seen the rocket booster come back and land. And we also recover the nose cone or fairing. But we do not recover the upper stage. So we’ve gotten to the point where we’re about, you know, 70 to 80% reusable with Falcon 9. With Starship, we’re going for 100% reusable. I cannot say how profound a change this will be. But a fully and rapidly reusable orbital rocket has the potential to drop the cost of access to space by a factor of 1,000.\nAnd I should say also, Starship is a very big rocket. It’s more than twice the thrust of a Saturn 5, and about twice the mass. And also the entire ship is designed to land propulsively. It can land on its engines. So it can land on any solid surface in the solar system. If we can make Starship work, then it enables us to, over time, get anywhere in the solar system."

Not impossible, but extreme difficulty. Because it’s not like those who have developed rockets before weren’t aware of reusability. They were fully aware of reusability. Aircraft and cars are reusable.\nIt’s just that in order for a rocket to be reusable, everything has to be perfect. So you have to have exceptionally efficient engines. You have to have an exceptionally efficient structure. You need advanced avionics and software. You need a very lightweight heat shield for orbital reentry.

Those are the things that are necessary. And it’s never been achieved before. There have been many attempts to achieve it, and basically, they’ve all failed.

One is the defensive reason, where we just want the light of consciousness to not be extinguished if something would happen to Earth. In the case of the dinosaurs, they only had to worry about, like, you know, meteors and super volcanoes and other things. But for us humans, we actually have the power to destroy ourselves with nuclear weapons or some sort of crazy bio-terrorism thing. So, there’s some danger that is not zero that could cause the end of life on Earth as we know it. So that’s kind of the defensive reason to ensure that life and consciousness is not only on Earth. That’s the defensive reason to protect the future of consciousness.\nThen the other big reason, I think, is that it’s exciting, and it’s adventurous, and it’s inspiring, and it makes you think positively about the future. You know, life can’t just be about solving one problem or another. There need to be reasons to be inspired or reasons that move your heart and say, “Yes, the future is going to be great!” when you get up. When you wake up in the morning, “I can’t wait to see what happens next!” And I think that’s humanity going to Mars. Even if you don’t yourself want to go to Mars – and most people don’t – just watch it. It’s a tough gig, frankly. This will not be a luxury expedition. But you’d be able to watch it happen. And I think it’ll just be incredibly inspiring to the world in the same way that the Apollo program was inspiring to the world. And like I said, life can’t just be about solving one problem or another. We need things that make us excited and inspired about the future. And that would be one of them."
