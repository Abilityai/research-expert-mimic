But if somebody dies when they’re 80 and they might’ve lived till 81, they lost one year. So it’s, “How many life years were lost” is probably the right metric to use."

Basically, if your kid’s got a runny nose, they should stay away from their grandparents, no matter what it is. There’re things where a young immune system has no problem; an older one has a problem. In fact, a lot of the deaths are literally, it’s tragic, but they’re intra-family. It’s, the little kid had a cold or flu and they…"

The exercise is like you want to develop strength and conditioning just so that you could be better at doing the thing.

We’re building new technologies and improving the fundamental product. So we’re not spending like doing hundreds of practice things or anything like that. We don’t have time for that. But, just hours before the demo, both Franz, Head of Design, and I were in the studio throwing steel balls at the window, and it’s bouncing right off. And like, “Okay, this seems pretty good. It seems like we got it.” Okay?\nAnd then, we think what happened was, when Franz hit the door with the sledgehammer to show, this is an exoskeleton, high strength, hardened steel… – You can literally wind up with a sledgehammer, full-on double-handed sledgehammer and hit the door and there’s not even a dent. It’s cool. But we think that cracked the corner of the glass at the bottom, and then, once you crack the corner of the glass, it’s game over. So then, when you threw the ball, that’s what cracked the glass. It didn’t go through, though."
