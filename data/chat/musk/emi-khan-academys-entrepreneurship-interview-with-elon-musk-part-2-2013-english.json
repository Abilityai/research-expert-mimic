In fact, we got progressively further, but the first rocket came in and landed maybe a couple hundred yards away from the launch site and\n(in)\ntiny fragments. So, yeah, anyway, that rocket ended up costing around $6 million compared to  other rockets in that class, which were about up to $25 million."

Right now, that is around what our comparison price is… excluding the refurbished ICBMs. So, if you say building a rocket from new, how does the SpaceX rocket compare to a rocket from Boeing or Lockheed? It’s about a quarter of the price. However, if we make it reusable, then it can be two orders of magnitude cheaper."

      "text": "Right. We’ve been working on it for a long time. I should say, SpaceX has been around for 11 years, and thus far, we have not recovered any rockets. We recovered the spacecraft from orbit. So that was great. But none of our attempts to recover the rocket stages have been successful.\nThe rocket stages have always blown up essentially on reentry. Now, we think we’ve figured out why that was the case. It’s a tricky thing because Earth’s gravity is really quite strong. With an advanced rocket, you can do maybe 2% to 3% of your lift-off mass to orbit, typically. And then reusability subtracts 2% to 3%. So then you’ve got like nothing to orbit or negative. That’s obviously not helpful.\nSo, the trick is to try to shift that from say 2%, 3% in an expendable configuration to make the rocket mass efficiency, engine efficiency, and so forth, so much better that it moves to maybe around 3.5% to 4% in expendable configuration. And then try to get clever about the reusability elements and try to drop that to around the 1.5% to 2% level. So you have a net payload to orbit of about 2%."

Do we have kind of market forces, commercialization of space starting to happen?"

      "role": "elon_musk",
      "text": "Yeah. Let’s see. Well, the first step is that we need to earn enough money to keep going as a company. So we have to make sure that we’re launching satellites. Commercial satellites like broadcast communications, mapping, government satellites that do scientific missions. Earth-based or space-based missions. GPS satellites. That kind of thing. And then also servicing the Space Station, transferring cargo to and from the Space Station, which we’ve done a few times. And then taking people to and from the Space Station.\nSo we’ve got to service the sort of Earth-based needs to launch satellites, and that pays the bills. But in doing that, keep improving the technology to a point where we can make full reusability work. And we have sufficient scale and sophistication to be able to take people to Mars."

What did you think… this is something that GM and Toyota and these massive multi-billion dollar organizations have been trying. What gave you the confidence to pursue it? And now that it seems to be a huge success, where do you think this industry’s going to be the next 5, 10 years?"

      "role": "elon_musk",

But because we have an un-priced externality in the cost of gasoline… – We weren’t pricing in the environmental effects of CO2 in the oceans and atmosphere. That’s causing the normal market forces to not function properly.\nAnd so the goal of Tesla is to try to act as a catalyst to accelerate those sort of normal forces. The normal sort of market reaction that would occur. We’re trying to have a catalytic effect on that. And try to make it happen, I don’t know, maybe ten years sooner than it would otherwise occur. That’s the goal of Tesla. So that’s the reason we’re making electric cars and not any other kind of car. And we also supply powertrains to Toyota and to Mercedes and maybe to other car companies in the future to accelerate their production of electric vehicles. So that’s the goal there. And so far, it’s working out pretty well."

    {
      "role": "elon_musk",
      "text": "I mean, yeah. Our goal, it’s not to become a big brand or to compete with Honda Civics, rather to advance the cause of electric vehicles. We’re just going to keep making more and more electric cars and driving the price point down until the industry is very firmly electric. Like maybe half of all cars made are electric or something like that, which is not to say that we expect to make half of all cars. We want to just have that catalytic effect until at least that occurs. The point at which we’re approaching half of all new cars made are electric, then I think I would consider that to be the victory condition. The faster we can bring that day, the better."

What usually happens is people under-predict it in the beginning because people tend to extrapolate in a straight line. And then they’ll over-predict it at the midpoint because there’s late adopters. And then it’ll actually take longer than people think at the mid-point, but much shorter than people think at the beginning. But I’m pretty excited about how things are going. And, in fact, I think that the pace of technology improvement in electric energy storage is really moving faster than anyone thinks."

But I think a lot of things that I would say you’ve probably heard 100 times. And, in fact, if not doing, the more you can game-ify the process of learning, the better.

And that lack of enthusiasm is conveyed to the students. They’re not very excited about it. They don’t know why they’re there. Like why are we learning this stuff? We don’t even know why. In fact, I think a lot of things that people learn – that probably there’s no point in learning them. Because they never use them in the future."

Because a lot of kids are probably just in school, probably puzzled as to why they’re there. I think if you can explain the why of things, then that makes a huge difference to people’s motivation. Then they understand the purpose. I think that’s pretty important.\nAnd just make it entertaining. But I think just in general conventional education should be massively overhauled. And I’m sure you pretty much agree with that. I mean, the analogy I sometimes use is, have you seen, like, Batman, the Chris Nolan movie, the recent one. And it’s pretty freaking awesome. And you’ve got incredible special effects, great script, multiple takes, amazing actors, and great sound, and it’s very engaging.\nBut if you were to instead say, okay – even if you had the same script, so at least it’s the same script – and you said, okay, now that script, instead of having movies, we’re going to have that script performed by the local town troop. And so, in every small town in America, if movies didn’t exist, they’d have to then recreate The Dark Knight. With like home-sewn costumes and like jumping across the stage. And not really getting their lines quite right. And not really looking like the people in the movie. And no special effects. And I mean, that would suck. It would be terrible."

But we do have time, probably 5 or 10 minutes, for a handful of questions. If none of you all have any, I have about nine more. But, yes.\nSpeaker A:\nI noticed… I picked up two kinds of themes from what you were discussing. One was somewhat audacious goals. And the other was I don’t think I heard you use the word profit in anything that you spoke about. Each thing is pointed at, like re-invigorating an industry or bringing back space missions. How much of your success do you attribute to having really audacious goals or versus just not being focused on the short term, money coming in, or I don’t know, investors?"

      "role": "elon_musk",
      "text": "Unfortunately,  one does have to be focused on the short time and money coming in when creating a company because otherwise, the company will die. So I think that a lot of times people think creating a company is going to be fun. I would say it’s really not that fun. I mean, there are periods of fun. And there are periods where it’s just awful.\nAnd, particularly, if you’re the CEO of the company, you actually have a distillation of all the worst problems in the company. There’s no point in spending your time on things that are going right. So you’re only spending your time on things that are going wrong. And there are things that are going wrong that other people can’t take care of. So you have like the worst. You have a filter for the crappiest problems in the company. The most pernicious and painful problems. So I think you have to feel quite compelled to do it. And have a fairly high pain threshold.\nThere’s a friend of mine who says starting a company is like staring into the abyss and eating glass. And there’s some truth to that. The staring into the abyss part is that you’re going to be constantly facing the extermination of the company. Because most start-ups fail. It’s like 90%, it could be 99% of start-ups fail. So that’s the staring into the abyss part. You’re constantly saying, “Okay, if I don’t get this right, the company will die,” which can be quite stressful. And then the eating glass part is you’ve got to work on the problems that the company needs you to work on and not the problems you want to work on. And so you end up working on problems that you really wish you weren’t working on. And so that’s the eating glass part. And that goes on for a long time.\nSpeaker A:\nSo how do you keep your focus on the big picture when you’re constantly faced with, we could be out of business in a month?"

      "role": "elon_musk",
      "text": "Well, it’s just a very small percentage of mental energy is on the big picture. Like, you know where you’re generally heading for, and the actual path is going to be some sort of zigzaggy thing in that direction. You’re trying not to deviate too far from the path that you want to be on, but you’re going to have to that to some degree. But I don’t want to diminish the… I think the profit motive is a good one if the rules of an industry are properly set up.\nThere’s nothing fundamentally wrong with profit. In fact, profit just means that people are paying you more for whatever you’re doing than you’re spending to create it. That’s a good thing. And if that’s not the case, then you’ll be out of business. And rightfully so. Because you’re not adding enough value. Now there are cases, of course, where people will do bad things in order to achieve profit, but that’s actually quite unusual. Because usually, the rules are set up mostly correctly. Like not completely, but mostly correctly."

And so that’s I think how… if you come up with a new technology, it should feel like that. You should really… if you told it to an objective person, would they look forward to the day that that thing became available?
