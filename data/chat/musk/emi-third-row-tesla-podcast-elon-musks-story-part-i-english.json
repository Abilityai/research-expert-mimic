And then a couple of friends of mine, Bill Lee and Jason Calacanis, said, they both said, “Hey, you should really use Twitter to get your message out. And also, somebody’s tweeting in your name, and they’re saying crazy things.” So I was, „I’ll say crazy things in my name.“"

      "text": "That’s quite unusual. So,you know, almost everyone diversifies to some degree.  And then the only stock that I have of significance outside of Tesla is SpaceX, which is a private corporation. And then, in order to get liquidity, which is mostly to reinvest in SpaceX and Tesla, and occasionally in, like, provide funding for much more projects like Neuralink and Boring Company, then I’ll actually take out loans against the Tesla and SpaceX stock. So, what I actually have is, whatever my Tesla and SpaceX stock is, and then there’s about a billion dollars of debt against that.\nYou know, this  is sort of taken to apply that I’m claiming that I have no money, which I’m not claiming. But it’s something to make it clear that you’ll see some big number, like four billion or something, people will think I have the Tesla and SpaceX stock, and I have the cash, and I’m being somehow… I’m just sitting on the cash doing nothing, like hoarding resources and like… no, it’s, you know, the only alternative would be to say, “Okay, let’s give the stock to the government,” or something. And then the government would be running things, and the government just is not good at running things. That’s the main thing.\nThere’s like a fundamental sort of question of like, consumption versus capital allocation. That is probably going to get me into trouble, but the paradigm of, say, communism versus capitalism, I think, is fundamentally sort of orthogonal to the reality of actual economics in some ways. So, what you actually care about is the responsiveness of the feedback loops to the maximizing happiness of the population. And if more resources are controlled by entities that have poor response in their feedback loops, so if it’s like a monopoly corporation or a small oligopoly… – or in the limit, I would say, the monopolistic corporation in the limit is the government.\nThis is not to say people who work for the government are bad. If you have those same people are taken and put in a better sort of operating system situation , their outcome will be much better.  So, it’s really just, what is the responsiveness of the organization to maximizing the happiness of the people. Andso you want to have a competitive situation where it’s truly competitive, where companies aren’t gaming the system, and then, where the rules are set correctly.\nAnd then you need to be on the alert for regulatory capture, where the referees are, in fact, captured by the players, which is, you know… – The player should not control the referees, essentially, which can happen. You know, things like that happened, for example, with, I think, the zero-emission-vehicle mandate in California, where California was like really strict on EVs. And then the car companies managed to sort of, frankly, in my view, trick the regulators into saying, “Okay, you don’t need to be so hardcore about EVs and instead you say, sell fuel cells in the future.” But fuel cells, of course, are many years away certainly – forever. Cities then, they let up the rules, and then GM recalled the EV1 and crashed it into a junkyard which was against the wishes of the owners…"

And it’s like, you know, the owners of the EV1, which while this wasn’t actually that great of a car, but they still wanted the electric car so bad that they held a candlelight vigil at the junkyard where their cars were crushed. It was like a prisoner being executed or something like that. That was literally… and like when is the last time you even heard of that for a product? Yet GM stopped the product. I mean, listen, man, they don’t do that for any other GM product. It’s kind of, sometimes it’s hard to get through these guys.\nSo I think that’s a very important thing. Generally, we could see these oligopolies forming, or duopolies. And then you get effective price-fixing, and then they cut back on R&D\n(research and development)\nbudget. Like, kind of a silly one,  frankly, it’s like candy. Like there’s a candy oligopoly.And it’s like, we don’t see much innovation in candy."

So that’s what asin  physics and computer… I mean, I got distinctions in two areas, in physics and computer science. And those were… so, my two best subjects and then I thought, okay, well, I want to figure out what’s the nature of the universe. And so, you know, go try to working with people banging particles together, see what happens. And that sort of things went along in that the supercollider got canceled in the US. And that actually I was like, whoa, you know, what if I am working at a collider, I spent all these years, and then the government just canceled it. And then that was like, I cannot do that.\nSo, roll back a little, like, I tried to figure what was – when I was a kid, I had like this existential crisis when I was about 12 years old or something. And I was like, well, what does the world mean? What’s it all about? We’re living some meaningless existence. And then I made the mistake of reading Nietzsche and Schopenhauer, and I was like, hoo… – Don’t do that. Not at… need be a little older. No, actually, lately, these days, I sort of reread it. You know, it’s actually not that bad. It’s got issues – no questions about that.\nAnyway – but then I read the ‘Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy’, Douglas Adams – which is really quite a good book on philosophy, I think – and was like, okay, we don’t really know what the answer is, obviously, but the universe is the answer. And that really, what are the questions we should be asking to better understand the nature of the universe? And so then, to the degree that we expand the scope and scale of consciousness, then we’ll better be able to ask the questions and understand why we’re here, what it’s all about.\nAnd so, we should sort of take the set of actions that are most likely to result in us understanding what questions to ask about the nature of the universe. Therefore, we must propagate human civilization on Earth as far into the future as possible and become a multi-planet species to again extend the scope and scale of consciousness  and increase the probable lifespan of consciousness, which is going to be, I think, probably a lot of machine consciousness as well in the future. And that’s the best we can do, basically, you know –\nyeah, that’s the best we can do.\nAnd think about the various problems that we’re facing or what would most likely change the future. When I was in college, there were five things that I thought would be – I mean, I thought these were actually… I would not regard this as a profound insight but rather an obvious one. The internet would fundamentally change humanity because it’s like, humanity would become more of a superorganism because the internet is like a nervous system. Now, suddenly, any part of the human organisms, anywhere, would have access to all the information instantly."

Your fingers wouldn’t know what’s going on, or your toes wouldn’t know what’s going on; it had to do it by diffusion. And the way information used to work was really by diffusion. One human would have to call another human or write them a letter. You’d have to write a letter, you’d have to have that letter to another human, they would be carried through a bunch of things; finally, the person would give it to you – extremely slow diffusion.\nAnd if you want access to books – if you did not have a library, you don’t have it. That’s it. Now you have access to all the books instantly. And you can be in a remote, like, you know, mountaintop, jungle location or something, and have access to all of humanity’s information if you’ve got a link to the internet. This was a fundamental and profound change. That’s one thing. I was on the internet early because of, you know, the physics community, that was pretty normal, although its interface was, you know, almost entirely text and hard to use.\nAnother one is obviously making life multi-planetary, making consciousness multi-planetary, changing human genetics , which I’m not doing, by the way. This is a thorny subject, but it is being done with CRISPR and others, you know. It will become normal, I think, to change the human genome. That will become normal."

Because if you mine and burn hydrocarbons, then you’re gonna run out of them. It’s not like by mining, sort of, say, metals, for example. You know, we recycle steel and aluminum. It’s not a change of energy state. Whereas if you take fossil fuels, you’re taking something from a high energy state, converting it to a lower energy state like CO2, which is extremely stable. You know, we will never run out of metals, not a problem. We will run out of mined hydrocarbons.\nAnd then necessarily, if we have got billions, ultimately trillions of tons of hydrocarbons that were buried deep underground in solid, liquid, gas form, whatever – they’re deep underground, and you sort of remove them from deep underground to the oceans and atmosphere, you will have a change in the chemistry of the surface, obviously.  And then there’s just a certain probability associated with, how bad will that be? And the range of possibilities goes from mildly bad to extremely bad. But then why would you run that experiment? That seems like the craziest experiment ever, especially since we have to go to sustainable energy anyway? Why would you run that experiment? This is just the maddest thing I’ve ever heard.\nI’m not saying there shouldn’t be some use of hydrocarbons on Earth, but there just should be the correct price paid on CO2 production. And the obvious thing to do is have a carbon tax; it’s a no-brainer. I don’t know, 90 plus percent of economists would say this, and, I think, of physicists. The market system works well if you’ve got the right price on things. It’s very simple. If you’ve got a price of zero, effectively, or very low, then it’s… well, people will behave accordingly, though. So, just that’s the thing that needs to get done. I think it will get done. And over time, as you raise the price on hydrocarbon, you can actually encourage sequestration technologies over time. And there’ll be a lot of innovation in that regard. And that’s the right way to do it."

You have enough money basically for an entire lifetime. Why go and put your money into SpaceX, which is a huge, you know, risky operation or Tesla? Why not just kind of, you know, relax?"

And then we (… 27:22) a road trip to Stanford with Robin Ren, who was in my physics class and now works at Tesla, actually.  He grew up in Shanghai. He’s a very smart guy. He ended up continuing at Stanford, and I ended up going on deferment a couple days into the semester. But I was going to be studying material science and the physics of high-energy-density capacitors for use in electric vehicles. So the intent was, I was going to work on energy storage solutions for electric vehicles.\nAnd I’d worked at a company called Pinnacle Research for a couple summers that did high-energy-density capacitors. I was going to try to do a factory like a solid-state version of what they were doing with… – It’s going to get very complicated from a technical standpoint, but they were using a ruthenium tantalum oxide. Ruthenium is extremely rare and expensive, you cannot scale that. So like, can you find a substitute for ruthenium – but you’re able to get to energy density which is comparable to that of a battery with incredibly high power density. I can go down a deep rabbit hole there."

      "text": "I wanted to use advanced chip-making equipment to make capacitors that were precise at a molecular level. You know, just a level of precision that was sort of unheard of in capacitors. Like, capacitor’s energy is a function of its area and a separation distance. So if you have a very tiny separation distance, and you can inhibit quantum tunneling, like… – things get pretty esoteric, so you got to inhibit quantum tunneling give very short gap, and then you could, in theory, get to very high energy densities by making capacitors in the way that you would make an x86 processor. And since there are 10s of billions of dollars going into chip-making R&D, that I thought there might be a way to make an advanced capacitor using chip-making equipment instead of the conventional means."
