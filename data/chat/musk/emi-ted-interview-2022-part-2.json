We spoke last time we talked about reusability, and you had just demonstrated that spectacularly for the first time. Since then, you’ve gone on to build this monster rocket, Starship, which kind of changes the rules of the game in spectacular ways. Tell us about Starship."

      "role": "elon_musk",
      "text": "Yes. Starship is extremely fundamental. The holy grail of rocketry or space transport is full and rapid reusability. This has never been achieved. The closest that anything has come is our Falcon 9 rocket, where we are able to recover the first stage, the boost stage, which is probably about 60% of the cost of the vehicle or of the whole launch. Maybe 70%. And we’ve now done that over 100 times.\nSo with Starship, we will be recovering the entire thing. At least that’s the goal. And moreover, recovering it in such a way that it can be immediately re-flown. Whereas with Falcon 9, we still need to do some amount of refurbishment to the booster and to the fairing nose cone. But with Starship, the design goal is immediate re-flight. You just refill propellants and go again. This is gigantic. Just as it would be in any other mode of transport."

What is your latest timeline? One, for the first time, a Starship goes to Mars, presumably without people, but just equipment. Two, with people. Three, the sort of, okay, 100 people at a time. Let’s go."
    },
    {
      "role": "elon_musk",
      "text": "Sure. Well, just to put the cost thing into perspective. The expected cost of Starship putting 100 tons into orbit is significantly less than what it did cost to put our tiny Falcon 1 rocket into orbit. Just as the cost of flying a 747 around the world is less than the cost of a small airplane. You know, a small airplane that was thrown away. So it’s really pretty mind-boggling that the giant thing cost way less than the small thing. So it doesn’t use sort of exotic propellants or things that are difficult to obtain on Mars. It uses methane as fuel and it’s primarily oxygen – sort of roughly 77, 78% oxygen by weight. And Mars has a CO2 atmosphere and has water ice, which is CO2 plus H2O, so you can make CH4 methane and O2 oxygen on Mars."

But the fuel is a simple fuel that is easy to create on Mars and in many other parts of the solar system. So basically… And it’s all propulsive landing, no parachutes, nothing thrown away. It has a heat shield that’s capable of entering on Earth or Mars. We could even potentially go to Venus, but you don’t want to go there. Venus is hell, almost literally. But you could… It’s a generalized method of transport to anywhere in the solar system because the point at which you have propellant depo on Mars, you can then travel to the asteroid belt, and to the moons of Jupiter, and then to Saturn and ultimately, anywhere in the solar system."

So it’s giant rockets, and a lot of them. Just talking in terms of rough orders of magnitude, in order to create a self-sustaining city on Mars, I think you will need something on the order of a thousand ships.

And it’s where you have an intersection of sets of people who want to go because I think only a small percentage of humanity will want to go and can afford to go or get sponsorship in some manner. That intersection of sets, I think, needs to be a million people or something like that.\nAnd so it’s what can a million people afford or get sponsorship for, because I think governments will also pay for it, and people can take out loans. But I think at the point at which you say, okay, like, if moving to Mars costs are, for argument’s sake, $100,000, then I think, you know, almost anyone can work and save up and eventually have $100,000 and be able to go to Mars if they want. We want to make it available to anyone who wants to go.\nAnd it’s very important to emphasize that Mars, especially in the beginning, will not be luxurious. It will be dangerous, cramped, difficult, hard work. It’s kind of like that Shackleton ad for going to the Antarctic, which I think is actually not real, but it sounds real, and it’s cool.\nIt’s sort of like, the sales pitch for going to Mars is, “It’s dangerous, it’s cramped. You might not make it back. It’s difficult. It’s hard work.” That’s the sales pitch."

I think this is important for maximizing the probable lifespan of humanity or consciousness. Human civilization could come to an end for external reasons, like a giant meteor, or super volcanoes, or extreme climate change, or World War III, or, you know, any one of a number of reasons. But the probable life span of civilizational consciousness as we know it, which we should really view as this very delicate thing, like a small candle in a vast darkness. That’s what appears to be the case. We’re in this vast darkness of space, and there’s this little candle of consciousness that’s only really come about after four and a half billion years.

Well, maybe there are these various great filters that the aliens didn’t pass and so they eventually just ceased to exist. And one of the great filters is becoming a multi-planet species.

There’s a whole compilation online that we put together and others put together. It’s showing rockets are hard. I mean, the sheer amount of energy going through a rocket boggles the mind. So, you know, getting out of Earth’s gravity well is difficult. We have a strong gravity and a thick atmosphere. And Mars, which is less than 40%, it’s like 37% of Earth’s gravity and has a thin atmosphere. The ship alone can go all the way from the surface of Mars to the surface of Earth.

Like, your attempts to solve the climate problem have been as powerful as anyone else on the planet that I’m aware of. And I actually can’t understand… personally, I can’t understand the fact that you get all this criticism from the left about, “Oh my God, he’s so rich.” That’s disgusting. When climate is their issue, philanthropy is a topic that some people go to. Philanthropy is a hard topic. How do you think about that?"

SpaceX, Tesla, Neuralink and The Boring Company are philanthropy. If you say philanthropy is love of humanity, they are philanthropy. Tesla is accelerating sustainable energy. This is a love of… philanthropy. SpaceX is trying to ensure the long-term survival of humanity with a multi-planet species. This is love of humanity. You know, Neuralink is to help solve brain injuries and existential risk with AI. Love of humanity. Boring Company is trying to solve traffic, which is hell for most people, and that also is love of humanity."
