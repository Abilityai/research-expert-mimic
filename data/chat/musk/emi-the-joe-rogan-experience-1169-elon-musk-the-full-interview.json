Then other people asked us to dig tunnels, and so we said ‘yes’ in a few cases. And then we have a merchandise section that only has one piece of merchandise at a time. We started off with a cap, and there was only one thing. It was just ‘boringcompany.com/cap’ or ‘hat’, that’s it. Then we sold the hat’s limited edition. It just said ‘The Boring Company’.\nI’m a big fan of ‘Spaceballs’, the movie, and in ‘Spaceballs’ Yogurt goes through the merchandising section, and they have a flamethrower in the merchandising section of ‘Spaceballs’. “The kids love that one”. That’s the line when he pulls out the flamethrower. It’s like, we should do a flamethrower. So, we…"

The way the tunnel is constructed is, it’s constructed out of these interlocking segments, kind of like a snake. It’s like a snake exoskeleton with double seals. And so, even when the ground moves, it’s able – the tunnel actually is able to shift along with the ground like an underground snake. And it doesn’t crack or break, and it’s extremely unlikely that both seals would be broken. It’s capable of taking five atmospheres of pressure. It’s waterproof, methane proof, or gas-proof of any kind, and meets all California seismic requirements."

Because Eric Garcetti was coming by for the Hyperloop; he was going to attend the Hyperloop competition, which is a student competition we have for who can make the fastest pod in the Hyperloop. And he was coming.\nThe finals were going to be on Sunday afternoon, and so Eric was coming by on Sunday afternoon. I was like, you know, we should take this pit and then show Eric. So, we – this was like Friday morning, and then – yeah, it was about a little over 40 hours later, we dug the pit. It was like when 24/7 – 48 straight hours, something like that. And dug this big pit, and we showed Eric the pit. Like, obviously it’s just a pit. But hey, a hole in the ground is better than no hole in the ground."

You know, the auto industry fought seat belts I think for more than a decade; successfully fought any regulations on seat belts even though the numbers were extremely obvious. If you had a seatbelt on, you would be far less likely to die or seriously injured. It was unequivocal. And the industry fought this for years successfully.

And generally, people like their cortex, and they like their limbic system. I haven’t met anyone who wants to delete their limbic system or delete their cortex. Everybody seems to like both.\nAnd the cortex is mostly in service to the limbic system. People may think that their thinking part of themselves is in charge, but it’s mostly their limbic system that’s in charge. And the cortex is trying to make the limbic system happy. That’s what most of that computing power is oriented towards. How can I make the limbic system happy? That’s what it’s trying to do.\nNow, if we do have a third layer, which is the A.I. extension of yourself, that is also symbiotic.

I’ve thought about this quite a lot.I guess, thinking about an electric plane is that you want to go as high as possible, but you need a certain energy density in the battery pack because you have to overcome gravitational potential energy. Once you’ve overcome gravitational potential energy, and you’re out at a high altitude, the energy use in cruise is very low.\nAnd then, you can recapture a large part of the gravitational potential energy on the way down. So, you really don’t need any kind of reserve fuel, if you will, because you have the energy of height, gravitational potential energy. This is a lot of energy.\nSo, once you can get high, like the way to think about a plane is it’s a force balance. So, the force balance — So, a plane that is not accelerating is a neutral force balance. You have the force of gravity, you have the lift force, you have the wings. Then, you’ve got the force of the whatever thrusting device, so the propeller, or turbine, or whatever it is. And you’ve got the resistance force of the air.\nNow, the higher you go, the lower the air resistance is.  Air density drops exponentially, but drag increases with the square, and exponential beats the square. The higher you go, the faster you will go for the same amount of energy. And at a certain altitude, you can go supersonic with less energy per mile, quite a lot less energy per mile than an aircraft at 35,000 feet because it’s just a force balance."

Any power plant or car is fundamentally consuming the carbon capacity of the oceans and atmosphere, or just say atmosphere for short. So, like, you can say, okay, there’s a certain probability of something bad happening past a certain carbon concentration in the atmosphere.\nAnd so, there’s some uncertain number where if we put too much carbon into the atmosphere, things overheat, oceans warm up, ice caps melt, ocean real estate becomes a lot less valuable, you know, if something’s underwater, but it’s not clear what that number is. But, definitely, scientists, it’s really quite — The scientific consensus is overwhelming. Overwhelming.\nI mean, I don’t know any serious scientist, actually zero, literally zero who don’t think, you know, that we have quite a serious climate risk that we’re facing. And so, there’s fundamentally a subsidy occurring with every fossil fuel burning thing, power plants, aircraft, car, frankly even rockets. I mean, rockets use up — you know, they burn fuel. But there’s just — you know, with rockets, there’s just no other way to get to orbit, unfortunately. So, it’s the only way.\nBut with cars, there’s definitely a better way with electric cars.  And to generate the energy, do so with photovoltaics because we’ve got a giant thermonuclear reactor in the sky called the sun. It’s great. It sort of shows up every day, very reliable. So, if you can generate energy from solar panels stored up with batteries, you can have energy 24 hours a day.\nAnd then, you know, you can send to the poles or near to the north with, you know, high voltage lines. Most of the northern parts of the world tend to have a lot of hydropower as well. But, anyway, all fossil fuel-powered things have an inherent subsidy, which is their consumption of the carbon capacity of the atmosphere and oceans.\nSo, people tend to think like why should electric vehicles have a subsidy, but they’re not taking into account that all fossil fuel-burning vehicles fundamentally are subsidized by the cost, the environmental cost to Earth, but nobody’s paying for it. We are going to pay for it, obviously. In the future, we’ll pay for it. It’s just not paid for now."
