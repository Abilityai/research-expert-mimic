We luckily got a tour through the program here at Brownsville. And I just see it says “Boca Chica, Gateway to Mars” (\nshows a bottle with the text on it\n). It’s kind of really exciting. I was really, really happy that I got the chance to see the product that’s being manufactured here, these rockets.\nIt’s spectacular the way they’re doing it, and it’s totally different than anything I’ve seen with rocket production at any other company. With that, I’d like to introduce Mr. Musk, and I guess we’ll… maybe you could answer two questions or actually talk. I’d rather hear from you than talk. I’ve been doing a lot of talking lately, and I’ve had criticisms in the past of, you know…"

And people are coming up and showing us their car and telling us about their experiences with the Tesla. These guys are really deep into loving this thing. And it doesn’t matter whether it’s that eight-year-old or six-year-old kid, they came up “Hey, mister, are you Sandy Munro?”\nPeople know, and they’re deeply involved in the Tesla. And yet, for some reason or other, we have a couple of little problems with our car, and then I see another car, and it’s a perfect build. If I would have had that – any kind of comment or response or whatever from that would be greatly appreciated."

If friends come up and ask me, “When should I buy a Tesla?” I’m like, well, either buy it right at the beginning or when the production reaches a steady state. But during that production ramp, it’s super hard to be in vertical climb mode and get everything right on the little details. It’s just a super difficult thing. If you really want things to be ideal, it’s actually very early cars or once the production is leveled off. That’s when it’s going to be best."

But the paint was a big deal. But now, this other car I saw – and it was a Model 3 with a white interior, which I personally think is the better color; we got black – but that thing was absolutely pristine perfect. That’s as good as anybody could possibly do. I just don’t understand it. Mine was built this month, his was a month later, mine had problems, his is perfect."

We were able to really focus on it and improve it a great deal. One of the things that was happening when we were ramp (… 03:51) from production was the paint wasn’t necessarily drying enough. If you go faster, you just discover these things. If we knew them in advance, we’d fix them in advance. But you ramp the line, and then the paint that had an extra sort of minute to dry or two minutes or whatever now doesn’t have the two minutes, and so it was more prone to have issues. This is one example.\nProduction is hell. The real thing that, I think, is unique for cars, for Tesla, is achieving volume production. Any American start-up car company – I think, Tesla is the first to achieve volume production in a hundred years, basically. I think Chrysler was the last one. Prototypes are relatively speaking easy, and they’re also fun. Prototypes are easy and fun, and then reaching volume production  with a reliable product at an affordable price is excruciatingly difficult."

But the Model Y, when we tore that down, people were coming up “Hey, which one should I buy?” and I said that I’m not into doing that, but if I’m going to buy an electric car – and we’ve seen everybody’s, I mean we’ve torn everybody’s electric car apart – If I was going to tell somebody to buy one and he had to have one I would suggest the Model Y. And lots of people did that.\nThis one, this Model 3 we’ve got, this may be the second one that I’m going to suggest. You can either have one of these two and then I won’t have to worry about you coming back and telling me there’s something wrong with my skull or something. They both work really well.\nAnd I have to tell you, we’ve gone about almost 6,000 whatever – I can’t remember – 6,000 plus miles so far in a couple of days, in a few days. And the seats in your car are phenomenal, absolutely phenomenal. I can’t say enough about them. I drive a Jeep Wrangler, and if I had to sit in that seat for an hour, I had to get a chiropractor and probably surgery. These seats – we were sitting in them for hours and hours and hours and hours, and there’s no fatigue. They’re brilliant. And you make them yourself."

If your butt hurts, it’s basically going to be because there’s some part of the seat that is producing a pressure peak. And that’s going to just cut off your circulation and make your butt hurt. But there have been quite a few iterations, in fact.\nThe early Model S’s had probably the worst seat of any car I’ve ever sat in. I called it the ‘stone toadstool’. If you wanted to sit on this stone toadstool, that was the early Model S’s seats. If you sat on it long enough, your butt would wear in eventually. Because your butt can repair itself, and the seat cannot. Eventually, it would be acceptably comfortable, but it would be a very difficult wearing process. We tried to go from stone toadstool to something that feels great. So that you can sit in for a long time and it’s still comfortable. That was a long journey and a lot of effort."

But I have to tell you about the best stuff. We had the beta autopilot system, and we did have problems.  But the problems weren’t with your system. They were with the roads. Either they don’t paint in certain areas, or they paint right in the center. So, how are we going to let legislation to make it so that things are consistent between states.

What really matters, the prime directive for the autopilot system is don’t crash. That really overrides everything.\nNo matter what lines say or how the road is done, the thing that needs to happen is minimizing the probability of impact while getting you to a destination conveniently and comfortably. But the prime directive, absolute priority is to minimize the probability of injury to yourself or to anyone on the road, pedestrians, or anything like that. It can’t be dependent on the road markings being correct or anything like that. It has to be ‘no matter what, it’s not going to crash’."

I have no idea; if I had to take that thing, a newer had to take it, I would be totally confused as to what to do where.\nBut when the car came into it, the lines are telling it ‘Go here,’ and that scared the living daylights out of me. If we would have crashed, if it would have been somebody – I used to race, and I can get out of stuff, and even though I’m old, I’m kind of agile – but if we had crashed, the press would have instantly said that it was all your fault. In essence, the fault lies in this massive mess that we were trying to keep up with, and then quite frankly, I stopped driving in the right-hand lane. That was it.

And you can hear me going – you know, my voice went up about three octaves, I was so excited, Cory said he’s got a sore ear from me giggling or whatever.\nI’ve sat in F18s; I didn’t fly them, but I was sat in them, and I saw how everything was supposed to work on the ground. I flew a C17 through a simulator. I know what you can do and what you can’t do with autopilot. And I never ever seen anything quite like what you’ve got in the new self-driving thing. This is just absolutely brilliant. This should get into the marketplaces as fast as possible.\nIt’s accurate; it’s much more accurate than what we have in the Model 3. It’s kind of aggressive because if there’s a hole, it will find that hole. It makes left-hand turns, which I’ve heard from everybody can’t be done.

Somebody would say something like, “What’s the best material to make this little section of the body out of, and what’s the right material to make this little section?” And I think we’ve got probably the best material science team in the world at Tesla.

And they’re all true individually, but they were not true collectively. When you try to join all these dissimilar metal, dissimilar alloys, you have galvanic corrosion, you got to have better seal, and you’ve got gaps that you’ve got to seal, and you’ve got to join these things, and some of them need to be joined with rivets, some need to be joined with spot welds, some need to be joined with resin or with resin and spot welds.\nFrankly, it looks like a sort of a bit of a Frankenstein situation when you look at it all together. I can’t emphasize enough the nightmare of sealing in between the gaps. That might be the most painful job in the whole factory, spackling on the sealant. There’s like a little error with curing the sealant or like just somebody who’s been working for several hours makes a slight mistake, then you’ve got an MBH issue because you’ve got a little hole and you’ve got a leak issue. This is terrible.\nI mean, you can muscle through it, and we have, but it’s just way better to have a single piece casting. Then you don’t have any gaps, no sealant, you don’t have dissimilar metals, and you can reduce the size of the body shop dramatically. So, just having the rear body castings for Model Y  allowed us to reduce the body shop by 30%. There are roughly a thousand robots on the Model 3 body line, which by the way is also not a figure of merit. You want fewer things, not more. We got rid of 300 robots, just for that rear body casting. When we go to the front body casting, we’ll get rid of another 300 robots."

Structural pack is an important thing that I’ve been wanting to do since the beginning of the company. But it was always tough because it’s a coupled problem. And when you’re in a sort of high-speed R&D, you often want to decouple the problems so you can try to solve electrical issues in the battery, and you’re trying to solve structural issues, and if you bring them together, then it’s hard. You’re putting the whole company at risk, basically.\nBut now, since we have Model 3 and Model Y in production, and we have a new factory that’s getting built, this is our opportunity to say, okay, now we’re going to do a coupled problem where we’re going to combine the battery pack and basically the body chassis, the primary structure. And we’re going to transfer shears through the cans of the cells and just do shear transfer, which gives you a super stiff, real great moment of inertia.\nIt’s like a carbon – they do this with carbon fiber and composite sandwich like have an aluminum honeycomb with (… 23:42) carbon face sheets, and you get incredible shear transfer loss, a great moment of inertia; you get a real stiff big plate. Getting dual use of the cells – so, the cells become structure. And that’s like a point I was trying to make at the Battery Day presentation. But I think a lot of people didn’t quite understand why that’s such an important thing.\nThe cells today in every car are carried like a sack of potatoes. They actually have a negative structural value. They don’t serve to aiding the structure of the car, and they have to be isolated from the rest of the car, so it’s isolated from vibration and shock loads and that kind of thing. You’ve got to put mass into isolating the cells. Because otherwise, they will bang against the side of the battery casing, and that’s not good. But by essentially bonding the cells in there and where the bonding foam serves as both an adhesive and fire retardant. Basically, you get two bows with one stone."

I’m just explaining why this is such a good idea because you got people designing cars all over the planet, and they’re telling me why it’s not a good idea.

Well, let’s show you. This is what happens if you’ve got just a little floppy sheet, or you just have a limited number of stringers for shear transfer. You can see it’s still quite bendy. But as soon as you have a whole bunch of cans or honeycomb or anything like that and you bond an upper and lower face sheet, it gets crazy stiff. You just put them together like one thing’s floppy, and the other thing is stiff as hell.\nAnd that’s really what you want. This will also give, like, the torsional rigidity won’t be much better. So, if you’re trying to improve the ride and feel of the car, you say, like, what’s the frequency of this car. Is it like a real bendy spring, or is it tight? The feeling of, like, is this car tight, really – if people don’t understand, why does this car feel better than the other cars. Because your natural frequency is high, and you’ve got good torsional rigidity.\nAnd then another factor is what is your polar moment of inertia. Basically, to what degree is the mass group towards the center as opposed to spread out towards the outside. You can see this with an ice skater. If an ice skater holds arms out, you rotate slowly, brings arms in, rotate fast. That’s what meant by polar moment of inertia. Can you rotate this car fast?

If you had the stiffness of the castings down below and you take a carbon fiber, basically, structure and put it over the top, absolutely every door is always going to be perfect. You won’t have to have fixtures; you won’t have to have anything. It just goes, “Boom, done.”\nThat’s ultimately what I think a perfect build is probably going to go for. But most people don’t want to do it because they’re talking about “Oh, carbon fiber is so expensive.” No, it’s not. It’s not really that expensive. At the end of the day, you have to take a look at the total account it costs. How much does it cost to, basically, where is all the tooling and whatnot, how about all the scrap that you get on and on and on?"

How is that possible? This will rip free. We tried this. I worked on the Boeing 787, and we tried that. You do the thermal expansion and contraction. It rips free from everything.\nBut clever design or clever engineering on BMW’s part made it so that you could do that. I’m not saying run out and do this right now. But eventually, you guys are material science experts. I mean, you make your own – we know a little bit about what’s inside those electric motors.

It’s going to cause the things to get a potato chip (… 33:00). It’s going to basically warp. So, we had to develop a custom alloy to make sure we could get good material properties but not require any step after the casting that could distort the shape. That is a very important thing.\nFor example, the Model S and X castings, for the original Model S, not the new one, but for the original, they required a heat treat step afterwards, and so it was always a pain in the neck because we couldn’t really expand the casting because it would run pretzel on us like just potato chip or pretzel it’s like – you can’t scale that. So, we had to develop an alloy that was okay and also had good elongation properties in the event of a crash. There’s like kind of a hard materials problems."
