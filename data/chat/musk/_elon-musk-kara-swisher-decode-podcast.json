Ford and Tesla made it barely through the last recession. There’s a good chance Ford doesn’t make it in the next recession.

Without Tesla, this would still happen. There would still be a transition to sustainable energy, but it would take much longer.

So the deepest mines are much deeper than the tallest buildings. But, really, the key is a massive improvement in tunneling technology. That’s the linchpin, that’s fundamentally what it amounts to.
