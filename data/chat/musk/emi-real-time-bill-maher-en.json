It has always been my view that… – as I was a history major, and when you study history, what you realize is that there’s the great man theory, and they talk about kings and princes and queens and presidents – it’s really the people in tech, who changed the world. They’re the people who deal the cards. Whether it’s fire, or electricity, for good or bad, or the cotton gin, or the iPhone, or the atom bomb, those are the cards and the rest of us just play it. Would you agree with that assessment?"

So obviously, you’ve got things like, say, the Gutenberg Press, before which it was very difficult to get books. They were very rare. Even if you had a thirst for knowledge, you really couldn’t do anything about it because there were very few books to read. And the internet is something beyond the Gutenberg Press, I think. When I first saw the internet coming into being in a way that the general public could use it, it felt like humanity as a whole was developing a nervous system. So previously, the way that information would travel would be via osmosis. One person to another or one person calling another. The access to information was very limited. Now with the Internet, it’s like having a nervous system. It’s like any part of humanity has access to almost all the information of humanity. You could be in the middle of the Amazon jungle with, say, a Starlink terminal and have access to more information than the President did in 1980."

I think Twitter is one of them. I mean, you have talked about this woke mind virus in really apocalyptic terms. You should explain why you don’t think it’s hyperbole to say things like it’s pushing civilization towards suicide. First of all, what is the woke mind virus, and if we don’t deal with this, nothing else can get done? Tell me why you think that?"

And yet we see from the, you know, in quotes “left” a desire to actually censor. And that seems crazy. I think we should be extremely concerned about anything that undermines the First Amendment. There’s a reason for the First Amendment, because people came from countries where they could not speak freely and where saying certain things would get you thrown into prison. And they were like, well, we don’t want that here. And by the way, in many parts of the world, including possibly that people might think are relatively similar to the United States, the speech laws are draconian."

And free speech is only relevant when it’s someone you don’t like saying something you don’t like because, obviously, speech that you like, that’s easy.

The amount of indoctrination that’s happening in schools and universities is, I think, far beyond what parents realize. And I only sort of came to realize this somewhat late.

It seems that that’s got to be a constitutional violation, what was going on there. Since I’m an avid Twitter user, I could detect that something’s not right here.
