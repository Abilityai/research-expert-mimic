I think that every kid gets excited about that. You don’t even need to teach them. It’s like instinctive. And so it’s very important for us to have reasons to be excited about life. Like when you wake up in the morning, it can’t just be about problems. I know everyone in this room deals with a lot of tough problems. But you know, it’s got to be more than that. I think a future where you say, hey, even if it’s not you, that’s going to be people out there, we are going to have a base on the Moon, we are going to have a city on Mars, maybe go further to the moons of Jupiter and everything.

I look at these things, say, if you look back from the future and say what’s the fundamental good of Tesla, I would say it probably should be assessed by how many years did Tesla accelerate the advent of sustainable energy.

Generally, they were saying like who’s starting a car company is crazy, you’re going to lose all your money. I was like, I think I probably will lose all my money, I agree, it isn’t like that I thought it would be successful. I thought we had maybe a 10% chance of success.

And then the guy said, this is unrealistic; this is never going to happen. In cars, people want to do something actively. And then you said, well, a hundred years ago nobody could imagine an elevator without a lift boy. Today nobody could imagine a lift with a lift boy. So, when is autonomous driving really, really going to happen and when are you able to do it, and when is it going to be approved?"

      "text": "First of all, I’m not against people driving, to be clear. I think people will drive cars basically as far into the future as I can imagine. It’s just that it’s going to be increasingly unusual to drive your own car. And, well, it’s fun to drive a well-handling car on a winding road in a beautiful train – of course, that’s fun. But it’s not fun to drive a car in terrible gridlocked traffic. Going through extreme traffic, that’s no fun driving a car. I think people are unlikely to most of the time want to commute and drive themselves. People are typically spending an hour and half a day, maybe two hours on average driving, especially let’s say like California or something (… 21:11) is very common. And some people will actually commute like three hours a day, sometimes it’s pretty crazy.\nIf say fast forward to like ten years from now, almost all cars will have full autonomy capability. All new cars produced. It’s about two billion cars and trucks in the existing fleet, and new vehicle production is about five percent of the fleet size, so about a hundred million. So even the point which all cars are autonomous, it will still take 20 years to replace all the cars assuming that the number of cars and trucks in the fleet stays constant. (… 22:00) ten years from now, I say the vast majority of cars are electric, like maybe 70, 80% or more, and almost all cars autonomous. Electric autonomy is the absolute in the future, no question. It’s just a question of when.\nThen like I said, as soon as people think that that means the global fleet gets replaced instantly, I say, no, we have to go 20 years beyond that point before – 20 years from the point which all new cars are electric, then the fleet will be replaced. So many people are used to like mobile phones and that kind of thing is like a two-year or three-year replacement rate, but cars are a much more expensive asset to longer life.\nAnyway, to actually answer your question, I’m extremely confident of achieving full autonomy and releasing it to the Tesla customer base next year. There is an uncertain period of time for how long regulatory approval will take. But I think if you are able to accumulate billions of kilometers of autonomous driving, then it’s difficult to argue. And look at the accident rate when the car is autonomous versus non-autonomous. And in fact, our statistics already show a massive difference when the car is on Autopilot or not on Autopilot. The safety is much greater, even with the current Autopilot software."

So this is, say, an A.I. that is smarter than a human in every way. It could even simulate a human. This is something we should be concerned about.

But that’s just because they live in a city. If you’re an aircraft and look down, they say if you dropped a cannonball, how often would you hit a person? Basically never. In fact, there’s stuff falling in from space all the time. Natural meteorites, old rocket stages, all the time. But nobody worries about it. Because the actual – in fact, there’s a good, a cool website called „Wait But Why“ and it’s got Tim Urban, like he actually just did the math and all humans on Earth could fit in the city of New York on one floor. We don’t even need the upper floors. That’s actually the cross-section of humans as seen from Earth is extremely tiny. Basically vanishingly small, almost nothing.\nSo, we need to watch out about population collapse. Low birth rate, I think, is a big risk, and it’s also not exactly top secret. You can go and look at Wikipedia, you know, birth rate. This is definitely the civilization ends with a whimper, not a bang because it would be a sad ending where the average age becomes very high and really the youth are effectively de facto enslaved to take care of the old people.

If they want to spend more time with me – actually, I asked them, „Are you sure you don’t want to hang out more?“ and they’re like, „No.“ So I think it’s probably the right amount then since they don’t want to hang out more.\nI think we really should take this seriously, the population collapse, artificial intelligence, obviously sustainable energy is important. The faster we transition to sustainable energy, the less of a gamble we’re taking with climate. I think there’s going to be a lot of breakthroughs on the medical front, particularly around the synthetic mRNA. Ultimately you can basically do anything with the synthetic RNA, DNA.

The party where I ended up wrestling with the world champion, which, by the way, also caused me to burst a disc in my neck. So five minutes of glory for five years of pain. That really hurt. That party was Victorian Japanese Steampunk. That was cool. I have to think of something for the half-century party."

Like there are just so many good things that you can experience, some of them cost nothing really. You know, you have a walk in nature or just a nice meal, and it’s like wow, that’s pretty great, you know. And we should take a moment to appreciate these little things, the big things. The things that move your heart. I think that’s probable the meaning of life as close as definition as I can think."
