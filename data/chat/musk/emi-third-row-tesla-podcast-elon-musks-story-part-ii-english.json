They’re obviously outsourcing the cells, but even outsourcing the modules and the packs. Yeah, you know, and it’s like, they’re really not thinking about fundamental chemistry improvements. There’s some pretty deep wizardry at Tesla on this front.\nOn this run, I should say a bit about electric vehicles or sustainable energy in general, you know. I said it was pretty, I think, obvious  not just to me, but to a lot of people – you may even go back 30 years or longer – that we must have a sustainable energy solution. In fact, it’s totally logical; if it’s not sustainable, we must, at some point, find an alternative to it. And so, even if there were no environmental impacts tothat sort of fossil fuel economy, then we’d run out of them. And then we’d have economic collapse and the world’s civilization fall apart.\nSo, that was actually my initial motivation for electric vehicles. It’s like, “Okay, we got to have a solution that does not require mining hydrocarbons, that is sustainable in the long term.” It was not actually initially from an environmental standpoint because I did not realize the gravity of the environmental situation at that time. And I thought, actually, for sure, by now we have electric cars."

Yeah, so on the sustainability front, it was really, like I said, initially not so much from an environmental standpoint, but from a necessity of replacing a finite resource in order to ensure that civilization could continue to grow. And then the urgency of it became much more obvious, like well, we really better do something because the environmental stuff is becoming quite serious.\nThe inertia of large existing companies is just too hard to appreciate. They just want to keep doing the same thing and maybe 5% different every year – maybe 5% difference. The companies hate change. At the time that Tesla was created, you know, there was no one doing electric cars. There weren’t really startups , big car companies weren’t doing it, GM and Toyota canceled their EV programs."

Or at least be unable to sell at prices that weren’t extremely high. But those are really the two main reasons.\nI think there’s also a third important reason that there’s just so much talent and drive in China that I think it’s a good place to do a lot of things. And the evidence is there in the incredible progress in the factory, which was built with very high quality in a very short period of time. And the cars coming out of Shanghai are already very high quality."

And so we’ve talked to them over a number of years, and they eventually said, okay, well, we’ll change the law. Other companies can do it as well. So it’s not just limited to Tesla."

It’s so much cheaper, not only faster; but it seems like you guys have learned so much from this – the Fremont factory – and that really enabled kind of a turbocharged build for Shanghai."

    {
      "role": "elon",
      "text": "Yeah, I think the big difference is we are way less dumb than we were. The portions of capital expenditures was very high, and it’s less high now. And then the Shanghai factory, we designed out all of or as much of the foolishness as we could think of that exists at Fremont and Nevada. So we just made a lot of decisions that weren’t smart, and we designed those out, so such the production line is much simpler. It’s much simpler and better implemented.\nAnd then, we also found like, in most cases, the suppliers were more efficient in China as well than in the US. So we’ve also managed to get a lot more output from existing equipment in the US as well. The Model 3 bodyline in Fremont, for example, was only ever meant to do 5,000 cars, Model 3s, a week, and it’s doing 7,000  – and with turning off a bunch of unnecessary things that were being done. There was a lot of foolish things that we’re doing. And we’ve changed some of the designs and made it easier. It’s like hundreds of little things to make it easier to build. And so being able to get 40% more output of the same line, obviously, makes a big difference – and while reducing the marginal cost of production, and I think improving the quality of the car. So it’s all good stuff – the result of a ton of hard work by a lot of people.\nSo yeah, it was kind of necessary in that way that there was… – we didn’t really have a place to put a second Model 3 body line. So it’s like we either make this one go faster, or we will not be able to achieve production. But the Model 3 body line in Shanghai is much, much simpler than the one in – (…41:16) – because it has the same end result. It’s much easier to understand this, just getting rid of unnecessary movement. There’s a lot of unnecessary movement in the Fremont body line, but not in Shanghai."

The CATL situation will be more of an integrated module than it will be a cell. It’s not super easy to replace these things. But we do expect to use CATL, we do expect to use LG. Currently, we’re using Panasonic. When I say ‘expect’ here, what I mean is like roughly a matter of months. So, by the middle of this year, we’ll probably be using both LG and CATL in volume."

There’s only one entrance or exit, which is like a little tunnel.

I didn’t think I’d be able to go because I paid my way through university, which is actually not that hard in Canada because the tuition is highly subsidized in Canada. So with basically some… – if you sort of work during the summer semester and take out some loans and get some scholarships, you can pretty much go to any college in Canada, I think.\nBut I met someone who was at UPenn, and they said you should at least apply, and I applied, and they actually gave me quite a big scholarship. That allowed me to go there, and so I did the physics and economics there . And then, that’s what led to the road trip to Stanford with Robin Ren. It was during that summer that I was like, “Okay, I can either spend several years kind of doing a Ph.D. in ….” – Not that I cared about the Ph.D., actually. I just needed a lab. But I could either spend a bunch of years working in a lab and maybe the technology would pan out, or maybe it wouldn’t. But the internet was definitely about to go supernova in 95. So it was like, “Okay, look, I can always come back to working on electric cars, basically,” which I did. “But the internet is not going to wait.”\nSo then I put Stanford on deferment and started up to which was really just … we started off with maps and directions, Yellow Pages, White Pages, that kind of thing. It was – that’s my knowledge – the first map and directions on the internet. So there’s still some patents I have – I don’t know if I have them anymore like I think they lapsed at this point – but for maps and directions and Yellow Pages and advertising and stuff. The whole initial codebase I wrote personally because there wasn’t anyone else. It was just me.\nI only had a few $1,000. My brother joined, and he brought like $5,000, which was a lot. Yeah, at least for the first few months, there was literally only one computer. So, when the website wasn’t working, it was because I was compiling code. And even to get an internet connection was pretty hard. But there was an internet service provider on the floor below us. We more or less squatted in this office because the landlord was always like out of the country or something, and nobody was using it."

      "text": "Most of them wouldn’t take a meeting. And if they did take a meeting, they were pretty bored and not… – They werelike, “Who’s made money in the internet? Like, no one, okay.” But the sea change occurred when Netscape went public. The first thing I tried to do was not to start a company. I tried to get a job at Netscape, but they didn’t reply to me. So I just tried to hang out in the lobby at Netscape. I didn’t know who to talk to. I was really too shy to talk to anyone. So, it’s like, “Okay, I can’t get a job at the only internet company that, you know, does internet software. So then I try writing software.” That’s kind of what happened there.\nAnd as I said, my brother came down and joined. This is all like late 95. And then in January 96, I think it was, there was a lot more interest in the internet stuff following the Netscape IPO. The software was more impressive, I guess. So, then Mohr Davidow invested – their VC firm on Sand Hill Road. And they invested… I think it was like $3 million for effectively 60% of the company, which we thought was crazy. Like, they’re gonna give us money for nothing? They must be mad. Yeah, so that seemed like crazy that they give so much money for a company that consists at the time of about five people – like literally, I think five people at the time . But it worked out well for them in the end.\nWe hired a lot more people. We bought out the service; and we also ended up writing a bunch of software to bring newspapers online, so Knight Ridder, New York Times Company, Hearst (…57:50) became investors and customers. And at one point, Zip2 was responsible for a significant section of the New York Times Company website. Yeah, so I got to know the media industry pretty well.\nWhat really happened with Zip2, effectively there was too much control by the existing media companies. (…58:19) board seats and too much voting control, and that they kept trying to push the company down directions that made no sense. Zip2 actually hadreally good software. That’s a software that’s comparable, in some ways more advanced than, say, Yahoo or Excite at the time, but it was just not being used properly. And it was all being forced through media companies, who would then not use it.\nSo it’s like, we’ve got the best technology, but it’s not been deployed properly. Fortunately, Compaq came along, and they … – Compaq acquired Digital Equipment, and Digital Equipment had AltaVista, which at the time was probably the best search engine. So their idea was they will combine AltaVista with a bunch of other internet companies and try to compete…  create a competitor to Yahoo or Excite. Excite used to be a big thing, amazingly. And Yahoo used to be a big thing."
