Alright, so the first question is, how is the spike detection implemented? Is it on the ASIC\n(application-specific integrated circuit)\n? Is it hardware and software updatable?\nPaul :\nYeah, I can answer that. I’m Paul; I’ve worked – I’ve had a few different hats – I’ve worked a little bit on digital chip design, and more recently working on some of the algorithms trying to decode the signals from the brain. The spike detection algorithm – there’s historically been many ways of detecting spikes. Typically, people will record data offline and then look for characteristic shapes. But here, we’re interested in detecting spikes online. And there’s a number of simple algorithms that you can do, for example, like detecting just a threshold. And we’ve been interested in doing a little bit better than that.\nWe actually look for particular shapes, charactered shapes that we think are spikes. And so we’re doing this on the chip; it’s for all 1024 electrodes; there’s bandpass filtering that’s happening on the chips. If you think of these as like little microphones, sending audio information, we’re basically filtering all of that in real-time and then looking for these characteristic shapes. You can configure what sort of shapes you are looking for, and that information is what’s being sent out. The raw information coming in the electrodes is way too much to send out over Bluetooth. So when you’re seeing those beautiful spike rasters on the screen, those are the detections that we have coming straight from the chips."

And so this is a hysteresis event where you have currents that flow and generate this… you can think of it as being a digital signal, a one or a zero that’s being sent in time, where neurons will send that signal to often 1000s of recipient neurons."

Sort of, like at a fundamental science level, it hasn’t been done in the past, I think, probably just because, like volumes of surgeries hasn’t been needed.

As this gets bigger and bigger, you’re going to be more constrained by the radio, so you’re going to want to push more of this on head, and that changes your programming model. But really, the APIs you’re getting are bin spikes, you’re getting raw waveforms, and that’s like, you can consume it basically like an audio feed."

And to be clear, we actually do insert, I guess, about three or four millimeters into the cortex. These electrodes are sensing from multiple layers within the cortex. It’s that there are deeper brain systems like that are underneath your cortex, like the hypothalamus. And I think that is something we’d want to interface with, for sure. Because that’s going to be important for curing things like depression, addiction, that kind of thing… anxiety.\nSo, but yeah, like as I said in the presentation, overall, we’re aiming for a general-purpose device. And really, the thing that would change between from interfacing with the cortex versus deep brain systems is kind of the length of the electrode. So we just need kind of longer wires and to adjust the robot in order to access deeper regions of the brain."

      "text": "Yeah, absolutely. I’m Felix Deku. I currently lead the microfabrication team. My team makes up of a group of process engineers and material scientists. And our job is to make the tiny wires – like Elon referred to them – or we call it threads, that are implanted in the brain. And of course, the threads are made of conductors and insulators, and choosing the right material that is amenable to the brain and compatible with the brain is something that our team has expertise in, and we work seriously on interface engineering, just to make sure that our layers are actually well thought through, well designed. At the end of the day, when we implant this right, they’ll be actually functional for either reading or for writing in the brain."
    },
    {
      "role": "elon_musk",
      "text": "Yeah, I think it’s going to be important in terms of material science problems, is making sure that the threads so the electrodes, can last for decades in the brain, which is a tricky thing because it’s a very corrosive environment and you’re in a dichotomy where you want to read, and you want to send electrical signals, and you want to generate electrical signals. But you don’t want to corrode the electrodes over time.\nSo, you need to have an insulating layer that is very robust but also very, very thin. It has to be just the right amount of insulation, and it has to stay that amount of insulation over time. So that’s why we think probably like a silicon carbide type insulator is probably the best long term from a material science standpoint. But silicon carbide is tough material to work with. But that’s probably the right choice long-term. Would you say?"
    },
    {
      "role": "felix",
      "text": "Yeah, I totally agree. And it – also apart from its electrical properties – it also helps with adhesion between the metal layers and the polymer substrate. Another thing that we are also looking at is since we are actually reducing the electrode dimensions, the electrode side, the axial side that actually speaks to the neuron, also have what we call high resistance to the signal. So, we actually looked into material engineering that will reduce the impedance at our interface so that we can actually have a very small electricity but still be able to speak clearly to the neuron."

      "text": "How thin? One strand of your hair is about 100 microns in diameter. We can think about dividing that into 20. So you know, one of the thickness that we recognize about five microns, and we have this facility to go even thinner in the nearest future."
    },
    {
      "role": "elon_musk",
      "text": "Yeah, we think we can probably go sub-micron in thickness. But obviously, the thinner you make the wire, the harder it is to sense the signal and to do stimulation because there’s less cross-sectional area for the current to traverse. And, yeah, in terms of upgrades, that’s part of why I wanted to show the explanted pig is to show that you can actually take the device out. And there’s no observable behavior change. The pig is as happy as before, and healthy.\nAnd I think this is going to be important for upgrades. Because obviously, if you get an early device, then by the time – let’s say you get version 1 – probably by the time we have version 3 or 4, you want to upgrade. You wouldn’t want version 1 of a phone, and ten years later, everyone’s got version 3 or 4. So it’s going to be important to be able to remove the device and upgrade it over time. So over time, the Neuralink would do even more than it did before."

And so we sort of sample it at 20 times that speed. And we have analog to digital converters that divide that into 1024 levels, so 10-bit resolution. And the spike detection is done in less than 900 nanoseconds, which is really, really fast time, and it’s only sort of determined by the speed of the clock. And for making sure that our implant is low power, we’re running them actually at a very slow speed.\nAnd then for stimulation, you know, we can actually create any arbitrary waveforms with about seven microseconds of resolution.

Obviously, as you imagine, you know, when you go to concerts, or there’s a lot of people, the signal quality does degrade because it is a pretty congested spectrum.\nSo, we are actually working on some new versions of the radio that are operating at different frequencies to be able to also send out a lot more data and have it be scalable to, you know, millions of electrodes. And then, also in terms of sort of electromagnetic compatibility and interferences, obviously, it’s very important for us to coexist with other systems and just disturbances out there.

I’m confident that long term, it will be possible to restore somebody’s full-body motion. So, if somebody even has a severed spine, they will be able to walk again, they will be able to use their hands. And like when you have a severed spinal cord, you essentially have broken wires.

So what we do is basically create an accelerated test chamber that can mimic the conditions that the devices will see in the body and basically test the devices at as fast as accelerated rate as we can. At this time, we’re limited temperature-wise by some of the electronics components. But basically, we can test subsystems to mimic the environment in the body.\nAnd by that, we’ve brought some devices in the test right now to almost a year. And all the implanted ones, prior to these implants, we had tested the same architecture and the tester to validate it. And yeah, so there’s obviously chemical things attacking the implant. There’s pressure; there’s mechanical shock and vibration. So all these things are part of it. And, yeah, I think one of the things that really helps is having everything insourced in-house. So we have the capability to deposit thin layers of metal, we have the capability to weld glass and machine micron scale with lasers, and yeah – so basically, we have all the tools in-house to be able to design any sort of sealing, enclosure, packaging that we need to do."

And historically, we’ve been unable to observe the neuronal correlates very well. And unless it’s in you, we’ve been able to observe the phenomenal state.

And I think this has been kind of a sort of recurring theme.

And it really gives us a unique opportunity to embed security as part of our design from the get-go and to make sure that there are no single points of failure.\nSo as an example, we can actually completely isolate sensitive modules, like the BLE\n(Bluetooth Low Energy)\nradio, by just segregating it out at the hardware level and really making sure that we protect the IO\n(input/output)\nto the brain away from any potential attacks, and really minimizing the attack surface.

You can train them to walk on treadmills; you can train them to do all kinds of tricks, and also that they have this large representation of the snout in the cortex, which you can very easily stimulate. So the question would be, why are we using pigs? And I think we’ve even surprised ourselves at how useful they are as a model in this respect. And another important point is that it’s very easy to keep pigs happy. They have very low needs, and so we can build an environment in which they have amazingly good welfare."

So, if we’re going to figure out things for people, then pigs were a good choice. And they’re also quite robust creatures, like little tanks. And then I think one of the questions was like, “Is the device itself robust?” And it’s like, well, you know, pigs, they bustle around quite a lot. And they bump into things, and they headbutt each other at times, and they’re pretty animated.

And I think that’s possible, I think it should be possible to get it similar to LASIK.

And there was nothing out there that could basically do those two things. And so that’s why we had to build a full custom ASIC. And there’s really nothing like it out there.

And it’s difficult… – you can’t just explain to the pig, “Hey, you’ve got an implant in your head, why don’t you take care of it?”\nSo it’s got to be robust against, you know, a lot of head impacts essentially. So you know, I think maybe one of the things that isn’t super obvious is that the implant itself is attached to the skull, but the electrodes have long threads. So you can have quite a lot of movement, relative movement between the brain and the skull, without putting attention on the electrodes that are inserted in the cortex.\nSo, well, let’s see, maybe a couple more questions?
