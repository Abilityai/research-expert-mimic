There’s a consensus of scientists, a large consensus of scientists, who believe that if we haven’t completely eliminated greenhouse gases, or offset them completely by 2050, effectively, we’re inviting climate catastrophe. Do you believe there is a pathway to avoid that catastrophe? And what would it look like?"

So, so long as we are not complacent, as long as we have a high sense of urgency about moving towards a sustainable energy economy, then I think things will be fine. I can’t emphasize that enough, as long as we push hard and are not complacent, the future is gonna be great. Don’t worry about it. I mean, worry about it. But if you worry about it, ironically, it will be a self-unfulfilling prophecy.\nThere are three elements to a sustainable energy future. One is obviously sustainable energy generation, which is primarily wind and solar. There’s also hydro, geothermal. I’m actually pro-nuclear. I think nuclear is fine. And it’s going to be primarily solar and wind as the primary generators of energy. The second part is you need batteries to store the solar and wind energy because the sun doesn’t shine all the time, the wind doesn’t blow all the time. So, this needs a lot of stationary battery packs. And then you need electric transport, electric cars, electric planes, boats. And then ultimately, it’s not really possible to make electric rockets, but you can make the propellant used in rockets using sustainable energy."

So then, what are the limiting factors on progress? The limiting factor really will be battery cell production. That’s going to really be the fundamental rate driver. And then whatever the slowest element of the whole lithium-ion battery cells supply chain from mining, and the many steps of refining to ultimately creating a battery cell and putting it into a pack – that will be the limiting factor on progress towards sustainability."

The future is bright and good from an energy standpoint. And then, it will be possible to also use that energy to do carbon sequestration. It takes a lot of energy to pull carbon out of the atmosphere, just because in putting it in the atmosphere, it releases energy. So now, you know, obviously, in order to pull it out, you need to use a lot of energy. But if you’ve got a lot of sustainable energy from wind and solar, you can actually sequester carbon. You can reverse the CO2 parts per million of the atmosphere and oceans.\nAnd also, you can really have as much freshwater as you want. Earth is mostly water. We should call Earth water. It’s 70% water by surface area. Now, most of that is seawater, but it’s like, we just happened to be on the bit that’s land."

So, when it comes to predicting sales of Tesla vehicles, for example, I mean, you’ve kind of been amazing. I think in 2014, when Tesla had sold that year 60,000 cars, you said, “2020, I think we will do half a million a year.”"

Because if you were to plot the progress, the progress looks like a log curve. It’s like a series of log curves. So, most people don’t know what a log curve is, I suppose."

And then it happens again. And ultimately… these things, you know, in retrospect, they seem obvious. But in order to solve full self-driving properly, you actually have to solve real-world AI.\nBecause you say, like, what are the road networks designed to work with? They’re designed to work with a biological neural net, our brains, and with vision, our eyes. And so, in order to make it work with computers, you basically need to solve real-world AI and vision. We need cameras and silicon neural nets in order to have self-driving work for a system that was designed for eyes and biological neural nets. You know, I guess when we put it that way, it’s quite obvious that the only way to solve full self-driving is to solve real-world AI and sophisticated vision."

But if you look at one image out of a video, it’s actually quite hard to see what’s going on without ambiguity. But if you look at a video segment of a few seconds of video, that ambiguity resolves.\nThe first thing we had to do is, we tie all eight cameras together, so they’re synchronized so that all the frames are looked at simultaneously and labeled simultaneously by one person – because we still need human labeling. So that at least they’re not labeled at different times by different people in different ways. It’s sort of a surround picture. Then a very important part is to add the time dimension. You’re looking at surround video, and you’re labeling surround video. And this is actually quite difficult to do from a software standpoint. We had to write our own labeling tools and then create auto-labeling software to amplify the efficiency of human labelers because it’s quite hard to label a video.\nIn the beginning, it was taking several hours to label a 10-second video clip. This is not scalable. So basically, what you have to have is, you have to have surround video, and that surround video has to be primarily automatically labeled with humans just being editors of making slight corrections to the labeling of the video and then feeding back those corrections into the future auto labeler, so you get this flywheel eventually where the auto labeler is able to take in vast amounts of video, and with high accuracy automatically label the video for cars, lane lines, drive space,…"

It depends on the type of prediction. Some things, I guess, things involving software, you know, AI, whatever, are fundamentally harder to predict than others.

It’s very rare that it’ll be less than that.\nAs far as our predictions are concerned, what tends to happen in the media is that they will report all the wrong ones and ignore all the right ones. Or, you know, when writing an article about me – I’ve had a long career in multiple industries. If you list my sins, I sound like the worst person on Earth. But if you put those against the things I’ve done right, it makes much more sense. So essentially, the longer you do anything, the more mistakes that you will make cumulatively. Which, if you sum up those mistakes, will sound like I’m the worst predictor ever.\nBut for example, for Tesla vehicle growth, I said, I think we’d do 50%, and we’ve done 80%. But they don’t mention that one. I mean, I’m not sure what my exact track record is on predictions. They’re more optimistic than pessimistic, but they’re not all optimistic. Some of them are exceeded probably more or later. But they do come true. It’s very rare that they do not come true. It’s sort of like, you know, if there’s some radical technology prediction, the point is not that it was a few years late, but that it happened at all. That’s the more important part."

The two hard parts, I think… like obviously, companies like Boston Dynamics have shown that it’s possible to make quite compelling, sometimes alarming robots. So, from a sensors and actuators standpoint, it’s certainly been demonstrated by many that it’s possible to make a humanoid robot.\nThe things that are currently missing are enough intelligence for the robot to navigate the real world and do useful things without being explicitly instructed. So, the missing things are basically real-world intelligence and scaling up manufacturing. Those are two things that Tesla is very good at.

I guess the dangers would be the artificial general intelligence or digital superintelligence decouples from a collective human will, and goes in a direction that, for some reason, we don’t like. Whatever direction it might go. That’s sort of the idea behind Neuralink, is to try to more tightly couple collective human will to digital superintelligence. And also, along the way, solve a lot of brain injuries and spinal injuries and that kind of thing. So even if it doesn’t succeed in the greater goal, I think it will succeed in the goal of alleviating brain and spine damage."

The issue that we face here is that we are already a cyborg if you think about it. The computers are an extension of ourselves. And when we die, we have, like, a digital ghost. You know, all of our text messages and social media, emails. It’s quite eerie, actually, when someone dies, and everything online is still there.\nBut you say like, what’s the limitation? What is it that inhibits a human machine symbiosis? It’s the data rate. When you communicate, especially with the phone, you’re moving your thumbs very slowly. So you’re like moving your two little meat sticks at a rate that’s maybe 10 bits per second, optimistically, 100 bits per second. And computers are communicating at the gigabit level and beyond."

It’s all sort of in research labs, and there’s always like some cords sticking out of your head, and it is quite gruesome. It’s really, there’s no good product that actually does a good job and is high bandwidth and safe and something actually that you could buy and would want it to buy.\nBut the way to think of the Neuralink device is kind of like a Fitbit or an Apple Watch. That’s where we take out a sort of a small section of skull about the size of a quarter, replace that with what in many ways really is very much like a Fitbit, Apple Watch, or some kind of smartwatch thing. But with tiny wires, very, very tiny wires. Wires so tiny, it’s hard to even see them. And it’s very important to have very tiny wires so that, when they’re implanted, they don’t damage the brain."

This is not something that will suddenly… one day, we will have this incredible sort of whole-brain interface. It’s going to be, like, at least a decade of really just solving brain injuries and spinal injuries.

It’s something more important than that.” But it’s often just really a monkey instinct. We’re just monkeys with a computer stuck in our brain.\nSo, even though the cortex is sort of the smart, or the intelligent part of the brain, the thinking part of the brain, people are quite… I have not yet met anyone who wants to delete their limbic system or their cortex. They’re quite happy having both. Everyone wants both parts of their brain. And people really want their phones and their computers, which are really the tertiary, the third part of your intelligence.\nIt’s just that it’s… the bandwidth, the rate of communication with that tertiary layer is slow. It’s just a very tiny straw to this tertiary layer, and we want to make that tiny straw a big highway. I’m definitely not saying that this is going to solve everything.
