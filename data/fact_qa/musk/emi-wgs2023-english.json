    "fact": "Elon Musk decided to buy Twitter instead of creating a new platform because it would accelerate progress by 3 to 5 years.",

    "fact": "Musk envisions Twitter becoming part of an 'everything app' called X.com, which will provide various digital services including payments, information flow, and secure communications.",
    "src": "Well, you know, I have this sort of long-term vision of something called X.com from way back in the day, which is sort of like an everything app where it’s just maximally useful.

    "src": "I think there’s something that we’re putting a lot of effort into called 'Community Notes'. It’s currently just in English, but we will be expanding it to all languages. That is, I think, quite a good way to assess the truth of things where it’s the community itself, basically the people of Earth, who are basically not exactly voting but competing to provide the most accurate information.",

    "src": "With respect to education, I think, in general, some things that we could do to make it more compelling would be to explain to children why we are teaching a particular subject. [...] I also think that critical thinking is something that should be taught to children at a relatively young age.",

    "fact": "Musk does not believe the recent UFOs shot down are aliens and finds the lack of evidence for alien life troubling.",
    "src": "I don’t think it’s aliens, no. I do find the whole question of aliens a very interesting one, what is typically called the Fermi Paradox, which is: If the universe is really as old as science seems to think it is, where are the aliens?",
    "question": "What are your thoughts on the recent UFOs and the possibility of alien life?"

    "fact": "Elon Musk sleeps six hours a night and finds that sleeping less results in reduced productivity.",

    "src": "I played a significant role in the creation of OpenAI. Essentially at the time I was concerned that Google was not paying enough attention to AI safety, and so I, with a number of other people, created OpenAI. Although initially, it was created as an open-source nonprofit, and now it is closed source and for profit. I don’t have any stake in OpenAI anymore, nor am I on the Board, nor do I control it in any way.",
    "question": "What was your role in the creation of OpenAI and what is your current involvement with the organization?"
  },
  {
    "fact": "Musk acknowledges the significant risk of AI and advocates for regulatory oversight to ensure public safety.",
    "src": "I think we need to regulate AI safety, frankly. [...] I think we should have a similar sort of regulatory oversight for artificial intelligence because it is, I think, actually a bigger risk to society than cars or planes, or medicine.",
    "question": "Why do you believe regulatory oversight is necessary for AI and how does it compare to other industries?"
