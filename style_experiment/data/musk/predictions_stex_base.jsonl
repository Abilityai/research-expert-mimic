He believes that colonizing Mars is essential for the long-term survival of humanity, as it provides a backup plan in case of a catastrophic event on Earth.\n\n2. Neuralink and the future of artificial intelligence\n\nNeuralink is a neurotechnology company founded by Elon Musk in 2016. The company aims to develop brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) that can help treat various neurological conditions, such as paralysis, blindness, and deafness.\n\nIn addition to its medical applications, Neuralink is also working on developing technology that can allow humans to communicate with computers and machines using their thoughts. This technology could potentially revolutionize the way we interact with technology, making it more intuitive and seamless.\n\nMusk believes that the development of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) is a significant risk to humanity, and that it is essential to ensure that AI is aligned with human values and interests. He sees Neuralink's work on BMIs as a way to help humans maintain their agency in a world increasingly dominated by AI.\n\n3. Tesla and the future of electric vehicles\n\nTesla, Inc. is an American electric vehicle and clean energy company founded by Elon Musk in 2003. The company has disrupted the automotive industry with its innovative electric vehicles, such as the Model S, Model X, Model 3, and Model Y.\n\nTesla's mission is to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy. In addition to its electric vehicles, the company also produces solar panels and energy storage systems, such as the Powerwall and Powerpack.\n\nMusk believes that the widespread adoption of electric vehicles is essential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and combating climate change. He sees Tesla as a key player in this transition, and is working to make electric vehicles more affordable and accessible to the masses.\n\n4. The Boring Company and the future of transportation\n\nThe Boring Company is a tunneling and infrastructure company founded by Elon Musk in 2016. The company aims to solve traffic congestion by building a network of underground tunnels for high-speed transportation.\n\nThe Boring Company's vision is to create a vast network of tunnels beneath cities, allowing for the rapid and efficient movement of people and goods. This network could potentially reduce traffic congestion, improve air quality, and save time for commuters.\n\nMusk believes that the widespread adoption of underground transportation systems is essential for addressing the growing problem of traffic congestion in cities around the world. He sees The Boring Company as a key player in this solution, and is working to make the technology more affordable and accessible.\n\n5. PayPal and the future of finance\n\nPayPal is an American company that provides online payment systems. Musk co-founded the company in 1998, and it has since become a major player in the online payments industry.\n\nPayPal's mission is to democratize financial services and make them more accessible to people around the world.

{"pred":" If I were 22 today, I would still consider the same five problems as I did when I was younger:\n\n1. Sustainable Energy: This is still a critical issue, as we need to transition away from fossil fuels to clean energy sources like solar and wind power.\n2. Electric Vehicles: Electric vehicles are a key part of the solution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from transportation.\n3. Artificial Intelligence: AI has the potential to greatly improve our lives, but it also poses significant risks if not managed responsibly.\n4. Space Exploration: I believe that humanity needs to become a multi-planetary species in order to ensure our long-term survival.\n5. Neural Interfaces: This is a relatively new area for me, but I think that developing technology to allow humans to communicate directly with computers could have profound implications for our ability to understand and control complex systems.\n\nOf course, these are just a few of the many important problems that we face, and I'm constantly reevaluating my priorities as new technologies and challenges emerge.","answer":"Well, first of all, I think if somebody is doing something that is useful to the rest of society, I think that's a good thing. Like, it doesn't have to change theworld. If you make something that has high value to people... And frankly, even if it's something, if it's like just a little game or some improvement in photo sharing or something, if it has a small amount of good for a large number of people, It hink that's fine. Stuff doesn't need to change the world just to be good. But in terms of things that I think are most like to affect the future of humanity, I think AI is probably the single biggest item in the near-term that's likely to affect humanity. So, it's very important that we have the advent of AI in a good way. It's something that, if you could look into the crystal ball and to the future, you would like that outcome because it is something that could go wrong, as we've talked about many times. And so, we really need to make sure it goes right. So that's AI,working on AI and making sure it's great future. That's the most important thing, It hink, right now, the most pressing item. Then, I would say anything to do with genetics. If you can actually solve genetic diseases, if you can prevent dementia or Alzheimer's or something like that with genetic reprograming, that would be wonderful. So I think genetics might be the sort of second most important item. And then, I think, having a high-bandwidth interface to the brain. We're currently bandwidth-limited. We have a digital tertiary self in the form of out email capabilities, our computers, phones, applications. We're practically superhuman. But we're extremely bandwidth-constrained in that interface between the cortex and that tertiary digital form of yourself.

And the big aerospace companies had just had no interest in radical innovation. All they wanted to do was try tomake their old technology slightly better every year. And in fact, sometimes it would actually get worse. Particularly in rockets, it was pretty bad. In '69 we were able to go to the moon with the Saturn 5.

That's how any technology actually gets better. By itself, technology, if people don't work at it, actually will decline. Look at the history of civilizations,many civilizations.

{"pred":" Yes.\n\nSo, when I'm faced with a situation where everyone tells me it's a crazy idea, I try to ask myself a few questions.\n\nFirst, I try to understand the motivation behind the idea. Is it something that I truly believe in, or is it just something that I think sounds cool or interesting? If it's something that I truly believe in, then I'm more likely to pursue it, even if others think it's crazy.\n\nSecond, I try to consider the potential consequences of the idea. Is it something that could have a significant positive impact, or is it something that could have a negative impact? If it's something that could have a significant positive impact, then I'm more likely to pursue it, even if others think it's crazy.\n\nThird, I try to consider the potential risks of the idea. Is it something that could potentially harm me or others, or is it something that is relatively safe? If it's something that is relatively safe, then I'm more likely to pursue it, even if others think it's crazy.\n\nFourth, I try to consider the potential benefits of the idea. Is it something that could potentially help me or others, or is it something that is not particularly useful? If it's something that could potentially help me or others, then I'm more likely to pursue it, even if others think it's crazy.\n\nFinally, I try to consider the potential alternatives. Is there another way to achieve the same goal, or is this the only viable option? If there is another way to achieve the same goal, then I may choose to pursue that instead, even if it's not as exciting or innovative as the original idea.\n\nUltimately, I try to make decisions based on a combination of my own beliefs, the potential consequences, risks, benefits, and alternatives. And I try to be open to feedback and criticism, and to be willing to adjust my plans based on new information or perspectives.\n\nI also try to surround myself with people who are supportive and encouraging, and who can help me to see things from different perspectives. And I try to be open to learning from others, and to be willing to change my mind if I'm presented with compelling evidence or arguments.\n\nI think that's where the internal strength comes from. It's a combination of my own beliefs, my willingness to take risks, my ability to consider the potential consequences, risks, benefits, and alternatives, and my willingness to learn from others and to be open to feedback and criticism. And it's also a matter of having a strong sense of purpose and a clear vision of what I want to achieve.","answer":"It's like, people shouldn't think, well, \"I feel fear about this and therefore I shouldn't do it,\" it's normal to feel fear.

The positive future of AI lies in its ability to augment human capabilities, automate repetitive tasks, and provide insights that would be difficult or impossible for humans to glean on their own.\n\nTo achieve this positive future, we need to focus on developing AI that is ethical, transparent, and accountable. This means ensuring that AI systems are designed to respect human rights, are explainable and interpretable, and can be held accountable for their actions.\n\nWe also need to prioritize the development of AI that is safe and secure. This means building systems that are resilient to cyberattacks, that can detect and mitigate bias, and that can operate in a way that is safe for both humans and the environment.\n\nFinally, we need to prioritize the development of AI that is accessible to everyone. This means ensuring that AI systems are designed to be usable by people of all abilities, that they are affordable and available to everyone, and that they are designed to be inclusive and culturally sensitive.\n\nTo get there, we need to invest in research and development, we need to create policies that promote the responsible use of AI, and we need to work together to build a future where AI is a force for good.","answer":"Okay, I mean I do want to emphasize that this is not really something that I advocate or this is not prescriptive.

However, sometimes I may say things that are not well-received or that I later regret. I'm working on being more mindful of my words and their impact.\n\nNow, let's move on to Tesla. This year has been a challenging one for the company, with production delays and quality issues. How do you plan to address these issues and get back on track?\n\nKara Swisher: Yes, it has been a challenging year for Tesla. Can you talk about the production delays and quality issues, and how you plan to address them?\n\nElon Musk: Certainly. The production delays have been due to a number of factors, including supply chain disruptions, logistics issues, and the complexity of our vehicles. To address these issues, we are working closely with our suppliers to improve our supply chain, streamlining our logistics operations, and implementing more efficient manufacturing processes.\n\nAs for the quality issues, we are focusing on improving our quality control processes and increasing our focus on preventive maintenance. We are also investing in new technologies, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, to help us identify and address potential issues before they become problems.\n\nKara Swisher: Speaking of new technologies, let's talk about Neuralink. Can you give us an update on the progress of Neuralink and its potential impact on society?\n\nElon Musk: Neuralink is a company I founded with the goal of developing brain-machine interfaces that can help people with neurological disorders, such as paralysis, blindness, and deafness, to regain their abilities. We are making great progress in developing a device that can safely and effectively connect the human brain to computers.\n\nThe potential impact of Neuralink on society is enormous. Imagine being able to communicate with your loved ones who are far away, or being able to control a computer or a prosthetic limb with your thoughts. The possibilities are endless, and we are excited to be at the forefront of this technology.\n\nKara Swisher: Let's switch gears to SpaceX. You've had a number of successful launches this year, including the launch of the Crew Dragon spacecraft to the International Space Station. What's next for SpaceX?\n\nElon Musk: SpaceX has a number of exciting projects in the works. One of our main focuses is the development of Starship, a fully reusable spacecraft that will be capable of carrying up to 100 people to Mars and other destinations in the solar system. We are also working on the development of Starlink, a constellation of satellites that will provide high-speed internet to remote areas of the world.\n\nIn addition, we are continuing to work on the development of reusable rockets, which are a key part of our mission to make space travel more affordable and accessible. We believe that the future of space travel lies in reusable rockets, and we are committed to making this a reality.\n\nKara Swisher: Let's talk about The Boring Company. What's the latest with your plans for building a network of tunnels for transportation?\n\nElon Musk: The Boring Company is focused on building a network of tunnels for high-speed transportation, both for cars and for pedestrians. Our goal is to reduce traffic congestion and improve the overall efficiency of urban transportation.\n\nWe have completed a number of test tunnels, including one in Los Angeles, and we are currently working on a number of projects, including a tunnel system in Las Vegas and a loop system in Chicago. We are also exploring the possibility of building tunnels in other cities, including New York and Washington, D.C.\n\nKara Swisher: Finally, let's talk about your personal life. You've been through a lot in the past few years, including the divorce from your first wife and the breakup of your relationship with Amber Heard. How have you been coping, and what have you learned from these experiences?\n\nElon Musk: I have been through a lot in the past few years, and it has been a challenging time for me. However, I have learned a lot from these experiences, and I have come to appreciate the importance of self-reflection and personal growth.\n\nI have also learned the importance of prioritizing my health and well-being, and I have made a conscious effort to take care of myself, both physically and mentally. I have been working with a therapist, and I have found that this has been incredibly helpful in helping me process my emotions and move forward.\n\nKara Swisher: Thank you for sharing that with us, Elon.

The first stage of the Falcon 9 separates from the second stage, which continues the ascent to orbit. Once in orbit, the satellite is deployed from the second stage.

This includes electric vehicles, public transportation, biking, walking, and other forms of sustainable transportation.\n\nIn addition to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, sustainable transportation can also improve public health, reduce traffic congestion, and create jobs. It’s a win-win situation.\n\nWe need to invest in infrastructure, research, and development to make sustainable transportation a reality. This includes building charging stations for electric vehicles, improving public transportation systems, and creating safe and accessible bike lanes.\n\nIt’s also important to educate the public about the benefits of sustainable transportation and encourage them to make the switch. This can be done through campaigns, incentives, and policies that make sustainable transportation more convenient and affordable.\n\nUltimately, the transition to sustainable transportation is a necessary step towards a more sustainable and equitable future for all.","answer":"Yes.

{"pred":" DriveOn Navigation is a new feature that provides real-time, turn-by-turn navigation for drivers. It uses GPS technology to determine the user's current location and provides directions to their destination. The feature is designed to help drivers navigate unfamiliar areas, avoid traffic congestion, and find the quickest route to their destination.\n\nOne of the key benefits of DriveOn Navigation is its ability to provide real-time updates on traffic conditions, road closures, and other potential obstacles that may impact the driver's route. This information is used to dynamically adjust the route in real-time, helping drivers to avoid delays and arrive at their destination more quickly.\n\nAnother advantage of DriveOn Navigation is its integration with other features, such as voice commands and hands-free operation. This allows drivers to keep their hands on the wheel and their eyes on the road while still receiving navigation assistance.\n\nOverall, DriveOn Navigation is a valuable tool for drivers who want to save time, reduce stress, and improve their overall driving experience. It is available on a variety of devices, including smartphones, tablets, and in-car navigation systems.","answer":"That’s I think one of the first major steps toward full self-driving.

{"pred":" There are a few challenges that we're facing with these technologies. One of the main challenges is dealing with the variability of the environment. The world is a very complex place, and there's a lot of things that can change quickly. For example, a car might be parked on the side of the road one day, but the next day it might be gone. Or a construction zone might be there one day, but not the next.\n\nAnother challenge is dealing with the behavior of other drivers. People don't always follow the rules of the road, and they can be unpredictable. This can make it difficult for our self-driving cars to anticipate what other drivers will do and react accordingly.\n\nThere's also the challenge of dealing with edge cases. These are situations that are rare, but can still cause problems if they're not handled correctly. For example, what happens if a car suddenly stops in the middle of the road for no apparent reason? Or what happens if there's a sudden downpour of rain and the roads become slippery?\n\nFinally, there's the challenge of making self-driving cars safe for everyone. This means not only ensuring that the cars are able to drive safely in a variety of situations, but also making sure that they're able to interact safely with other vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists.\n\nOverall, the challenges are complex and multifaceted, but we're working hard to overcome them and bring self-driving cars to the masses.","answer":"Well, the main challenge has been improving the neural net so that we can recognize all types of objects from all eight cameras.

{"pred":" Yes, exactly. These are things that just happen in the real world, and they can be quite challenging for the neural net to handle. For example, if there's a car with a tarp on it, the neural net might not recognize it as a car. Or if there's a car with a bike rack on it, it might not recognize the bike rack.\n\nAnother challenge is dealing with different lighting conditions. The neural net needs to be able to recognize objects regardless of whether it's day or night, or whether the lighting is bright or dim.\n\nThere's also the challenge of dealing with occlusions, where one object is blocking the view of another object. For example, if a car is parked in front of a building, the neural net needs to be able to recognize the building even though the car is blocking part of it.\n\nAnd finally, there's the challenge of dealing with different angles. The neural net needs to be able to recognize objects from different angles, not just head-on.\n\nOverall, the main challenge is making the neural net robust enough to handle all these different corner cases and variations in the real world.","answer":"Yeah, the roads are pretty messy, so you could have, say, skid marks on the road that look like a line.

We’re also looking at things like V2X communication, which is vehicle-to-everything communication, where the vehicles can communicate with each other, with infrastructure, and with other road users.\n\nWe’re also working on developing standards for autonomous vehicles, so that they can operate safely and efficiently in a variety of different environments.

{"pred":" I apologize for the confusion. Let me clarify. We're not assuming that there won't be regulations, but we're not actively considering them in our current planning and design process.\n\nRegulations can vary greatly depending on the region, and they can change over time. It's challenging to predict the specifics of future regulations, especially in emerging technologies like smart infrastructure.\n\nHowever, we do recognize the importance of regulations in ensuring safety, privacy, and ethical use of technology. As we move forward, we will engage with relevant stakeholders, including government agencies, to understand the regulatory landscape and work towards compliance.\n\nIn the case of smart infrastructure projects, such as sensors in roads, we would need to consider regulations related to data privacy, cybersecurity, and infrastructure development. We would also need to ensure that our solutions are accessible and beneficial to all members of the community.\n\nIn summary, while we're not currently focusing on regulations, we understand their importance and will address them as we move forward in our planning and design process.","answer":"No. The car needs to drive better than a human driver using the same inputs as a human driver.

{"pred":" That's a great question. The finances of a space company can be quite complex, but I'll try to break it down into simpler terms.\n\nFirst, there are two main sources of funding for a space company: private investment and government contracts.\n\nPrivate investment can come from a variety of sources, such as venture capital firms, angel investors, and even individual investors. These investors provide capital in exchange for equity in the company, which means they own a portion of the company and share in its profits (or losses).\n\nGovernment contracts, on the other hand, provide a steady stream of revenue for a company. These contracts are typically awarded for specific projects, such as building a satellite or launching a mission to Mars.\n\nFor SpaceX, our primary source of funding has been private investment. Our founder, Elon Musk, initially invested a significant amount of his own money into the company. We've also raised funds from venture capital firms and other investors.\n\nHowever, SpaceX has also secured some government contracts, such as the contract to launch NASA's crewed missions to the International Space Station. These contracts provide a steady source of revenue and help to fund our other projects.\n\nIn addition to these sources of funding, SpaceX has also generated revenue by launching commercial satellites and by selling our reusable rockets to other companies.\n\nThe challenge with space companies is that they require a significant amount of capital to get off the ground. Building rockets and launching missions is an expensive endeavor, and it can take years (and many failed attempts) before a company starts to turn a profit. That's why it's so important for a space company to have a strong financial backing and a clear path to profitability.\n\nIn the case of SpaceX, our long-term goal is to reduce the cost of space travel to the point where it becomes accessible to everyone. We believe that this will create a massive market for our services and generate significant revenue for the company. But until we reach that point, we'll continue to rely on private investment and government contracts to fund our operations.","answer":"You know ...

{"pred":" Yes, a hovercraft is a type of vehicle that can travel over land, water, and other surfaces by using a cushion of air to lift and move the vehicle. It is propelled by fans that blow air beneath the vehicle, creating a cushion of air that lifts the vehicle off the ground or water surface. This allows the hovercraft to move over uneven terrain and water without sinking or becoming stuck.\n\nLarry Page, co-founder of Google, has expressed interest in developing a personal flying car, which could potentially use a hovercraft-like system for vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL). However, as of now, there are no commercially available hovercraft-like vehicles for personal use.\n\nThere are also other types of VTOL vehicles, such as drones, helicopters, and electric jets, which use different methods to achieve vertical takeoff and landing. These vehicles are currently being developed for various applications, including transportation, military, and delivery services.","answer":"No, hovercrafts are pretty straightforward.","messages":[{"content":"Do you have a vertical lift and takeoff?","role":"user"},{"content":"The supersonic VTOL jet, electric jet.","role":"assistant"},{"content":"Yeah.

{"pred":" I'm here to help you, so let's continue with your idea.\n\nA hovercraft like Larry Page, but with a twist. It would be a personal transportation device that uses advanced AI and machine learning to adapt to the user's movements and preferences. The craft would be equipped with a powerful propulsion system that allows it to hover above water, land, and even air.\n\nThe AI system would learn the user's preferred speed, route, and maneuvering style, and adjust the craft's performance accordingly. It would also be able to anticipate the user's movements and make adjustments to keep the craft stable and comfortable.\n\nThe craft would be designed for maximum efficiency, with a sleek and aerodynamic body that minimizes drag and maximizes lift. It would be powered by a clean and renewable energy source, such as solar or wind power, to reduce its carbon footprint.\n\nThe craft would be equipped with a suite of sensors and cameras that allow it to navigate safely and autonomously, even in complex environments. It would be able to avoid obstacles, follow roads and paths, and even recognize and respond to traffic signals and other road users.\n\nThe craft would be controlled using a simple and intuitive interface, such as voice commands or gestures. It would be easy to learn and use, even for people who have never flown a hovercraft before.\n\nOverall, this personal hovercraft would be a revolutionary new mode of transportation that combines the convenience and flexibility of a personal vehicle with the efficiency and sustainability of a clean energy source. It would be a game-changer for urban mobility, reducing traffic congestion, air pollution, and carbon emissions.","answer":"A supersonic vertical-takeoff-and-landing electric jet would be interesting to do at some point, I think.

{"pred":" So, the solar tiles are made of monocrystalline silicon, which is the same material that’s used in traditional solar panels. But instead of being flat and rigid, they’re designed to mimic the look of traditional roofing tiles.\n\nThe solar tiles are connected to a power inverter, which converts the DC electricity generated by the solar tiles into AC electricity that can be used in your home. The system is also connected to the grid, so any excess electricity generated is sent back to the grid and you can receive credits on your electricity bill.\n\nThe solar tiles are designed to be durable and long-lasting, with a lifespan of 30 years or more. They’re also designed to withstand harsh weather conditions, such as hail and high winds.\n\nOne of the main benefits of solar tiles is that they provide a clean, renewable source of energy for your home. They can help reduce your carbon footprint and save you money on your electricity bills in the long run.\n\nAnother benefit is that they can increase the value of your home, as more and more homebuyers are looking for properties with sustainable features.\n\nOverall, solar tiles are a great option for homeowners who want to go solar but don’t want to compromise on the aesthetic appeal of their roof. They offer a sleek, modern look while providing a clean, renewable source of energy.","answer":"And even when you do accelerated lab testing on a solar roof, it still takes a while.

{"pred":" Yeah, tunnels. But the idea of a three-dimensional subway system is not a new one. It's been proposed many times, but it's never really taken off because of the cost and the complexity of building it.\n\nOne of the most famous examples is the Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) subway system, which was proposed by a guy named Elmer Sperry in the 1940s. The idea was that you would have a subway car that would travel along a track, but instead of having a fixed track, it would be suspended from a cable. And then when it reached a station, it would detach from the cable, and it would use a jet engine to take off vertically and fly to the next station.\n\nAnother example is the Maglev system, which uses magnetic levitation to float the train above the track, reducing friction and allowing for faster speeds. This technology has been used in a few places, like Shanghai and Dubai, but it's still essentially a two-dimensional system.\n\nThe idea of a three-dimensional subway system is that you would have multiple layers of tracks, and you would have trains traveling in multiple directions, not just left and right, but also up and down. This would allow for much more efficient use of space, and it would also allow for much faster travel times.\n\nBut again, the cost and complexity of building such a system would be enormous. It would require a massive amount of infrastructure, and it would also require a lot of coordination between different levels of government, as well as private companies, to make it happen.\n\nSo while the idea of a three-dimensional subway system is intriguing, it's not something that's likely to happen anytime soon. But who knows, maybe one day we'll see it become a reality.","answer":"You could certainly have a subway system which had many layers of tunnels, but the tunnels are so prohibitively expensive that they don’t do it. But you can go down 100 levels if you want to; you could have 100 layers of tunnels on top of each other. You can go further down than you can go up. So the deepest mines are much deeper than the tallest buildings. But, really, the key is a massive improvement in tunneling technology. That’s the linchpin, that’s fundamentally what it amounts to. And as I got sort of digging into tunnels ... Ha-ha, good one.","messages":[{"content":"Right, like a subway system?","role":"user"},{"content":"Yeah, but even subways tend to be essentially two-dimensional.

{"pred":" I apologize for the unprofessional joke. Let me continue with the topic at hand.\n\nAs I got into tunnels, I realized that the key to tunneling is a massive improvement in tunneling technology. The current technology is very expensive, and it's very difficult to do. But if you could make it much cheaper and much easier, then you could have a whole new world of possibilities.\n\nOne of the things that I've been thinking about is the idea of a \"vertical farm\" that's underground. You could have a whole series of layers of tunnels, and each layer would have a different crop growing on it. You could have a layer of lettuce, a layer of tomatoes, a layer of cucumbers, and so on. And because you're underground, you don't have to worry about sunlight or weather. You could control the temperature, the humidity, the light, and so on.\n\nAnother idea is to have a series of tunnels that are used for transportation. You could have a whole network of tunnels that are used for trains, buses, and cars. This would allow you to move people and goods around much more efficiently than we do now.\n\nAnd then there's the idea of using tunnels for energy. You could have a series of tunnels that are used to transport energy from one place to another. This could be done using a variety of technologies, such as pipes for oil or gas, or cables for electricity.\n\nSo, in conclusion, tunnels are a fascinating subject, and there are many possibilities for their use. But the key is a massive improvement in tunneling technology. If we can make tunnels cheaper and easier to build, then we could open up a whole new world of possibilities.","answer":"Yeah, yeah, no, I’ve got a million of ’em.","messages":[{"content":"So tunnels?","role":"user"},{"content":"You could certainly have a subway system which had many layers of tunnels, but the tunnels are so prohibitively expensive that they don’t do it.

{"pred":" Ah, yes, I see what you mean. Well, the influence of the Saudi royal family, particularly Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, has been significant in Silicon Valley. This is due to the Saudi Vision 2030, an ambitious plan to diversify the Saudi economy and reduce its dependence on oil.\n\nAs part of this plan, the Saudi Public Investment Fund (PIF) has been investing heavily in technology companies, including those based in Silicon Valley. For example, in 2016, SoftBank, a major Japanese investor, announced a $100 billion technology fund, with $45 billion coming from the PIF. This fund has since invested in numerous tech companies, including Uber, WeWork, and Slack.\n\nThe Saudi royal family has also been actively courting Silicon Valley executives, inviting them to visit Saudi Arabia and participate in events like the Future Investment Initiative (Davos in the Desert). These efforts have helped to strengthen the ties between Saudi Arabia and Silicon Valley, and have opened up new opportunities for collaboration and investment.\n\nHowever, it’s important to note that this relationship has been controversial, particularly due to concerns about human rights and the Saudi government’s role in the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Some tech executives have faced criticism for their continued involvement with Saudi Arabia, and there have been calls for a boycott of the Future Investment Initiative.\n\nIn summary, the Saudi royal family has had a significant influence in Silicon Valley through their investments and efforts to court tech executives.

{"pred":" That's a great idea! An electric scooter could be a more affordable and practical option for you to start with. They are eco-friendly, easy to maneuver, and can be a fun way to get around the city. Plus, they take up less space than a car, which is a big advantage in urban areas. Here are a few things to consider when choosing an electric scooter:\n\n1. Range: How far do you plan on traveling on a single charge? Some scooters have a range of up to 40 miles, while others may only go 10-15 miles.\n2. Speed: How fast do you want to go? Most electric scooters have a top speed of around 20-25 mph, but some can go faster.\n3. Weight: How easy is it to carry the scooter when you're not riding it? Some scooters are lightweight and foldable, making them easy to transport.\n4. Price: How much are you willing to spend? Electric scooters can range in price from a few hundred dollars to several thousand dollars.\n5. Durability: How well does the scooter hold up over time? Look for a scooter with a sturdy frame and high-quality components.\n6. Safety: Does the scooter have features that promote safety, such as a headlight, brake light, and turn signals?\n7. Comfort: Is the scooter comfortable to ride? Look for a scooter with a comfortable seat, adjustable handlebars, and a smooth ride.\n\nI hope this helps you make a decision!
