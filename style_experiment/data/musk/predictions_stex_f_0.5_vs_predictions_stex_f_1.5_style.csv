Thanks for having me., Great to be here., My pleasure.,B,A
"Well, first of all, I think if somebody is doing something that is useful to the rest of society, I think that's a good thing. Like, it doesn't have to change theworld. If you make something that has high value to people... And frankly, even if it's something, if it's like just a little game or some improvement in photo sharing or something, if it has a small amount of good for a large number of people, It hink that's fine. Stuff doesn't need to change the world just to be good. But in terms of things that I think are most like to affect the future of humanity, I think AI is probably the single biggest item in the near-term that's likely to affect humanity. So, it's very important that we have the advent of AI in a good way. It's something that, if you could look into the crystal ball and to the future, you would like that outcome because it is something that could go wrong, as we've talked about many times. And so, we really need to make sure it goes right. So that's AI,working on AI and making sure it's great future. That's the most important thing, It hink, right now, the most pressing item. Then, I would say anything to do with genetics. If you can actually solve genetic diseases, if you can prevent dementia or Alzheimer's or something like that with genetic reprograming, that would be wonderful. So I think genetics might be the sort of second most important item. And then, I think, having a high-bandwidth interface to the brain. We're currently bandwidth-limited. We have a digital tertiary self in the form of out email capabilities, our computers, phones, applications. We're practically superhuman. But we're extremely bandwidth-constrained in that interface between the cortex and that tertiary digital form of yourself. And helping solve that bandwidth constraint would be, I think, very important in the future as well. Yeah."," Well, I think I’d probably still be working on the same things. I mean, I think the things that are most important are the things that are going to affect the future of humanity and the future of life on Earth. So, I think the things that are most important are the things that are going to affect the future of humanity and the future of life on Earth."," Well, I guess, working on solutions for existential risks for humanity, I think is something that I would work on. I think there’s a pretty good chance that we find some good solutions to the energy problems of the world, and we’re seeing that with the rapid growth of solar and wind. So that’s a good trend.
I think there’s still a lot of work to be done in developing sustainable energy solutions for the developing world. So that’s a big challenge. Sustainable energy solutions for high population density areas, like the Middle East, where you’ve got a lot of sun, but you don’t have a lot of space, and you’ve got a lot of people, so you need to really cram a lot of energy into a small space.
I think there’s a big challenge in the future of developing a sustainable energy transport system. So like, how do you make electric planes and supersonic electric jets and that kind of thing. And then, of course, there’s the challenge of becoming a multi-planet species and a spacefaring civilization. So I think those are all pretty exciting things.",B,B
"Well, first of all, I should say that I do not expect to be involved in all these things. So, the five things that I thought about at the time in college, so quite along time ago, 25 years ago, making life multi-planetary, accelerating the transmission to sustainable energy, the Internet broadly speaking, and then genetics, and AI. I didn't expect to be involved in all those things. Actually, at the time in college, I sort of thought helping with electrification of cars was how it would start out. That's actually what I worked on as an intern was advanced ultra-capacitors, to see if there would be a breakthrough relative to batteries for energy storage in cars. And then, when I came out to go to Stanford, that's what I was going to be doing my grad studies on was working on advanced energy storage technologies for electric cars. And I put that on hold to start an Internet company in '95 because there does seem to be a time for particular technologies when they're at a steep point in the inflection curve. And I didn't want to do a PHD atStanford and watch it all happen. I wasn't entirely certain that the technology I'd be working on would succeed. You can get a doctorate on many things that ultimately do not a have practical bearing on the world. And I really was just trying to be useful. That's the optimization. It's like, ""What can I do that would actually be useful?"""," Well, I think I've been very fortunate in that I've been able to start companies and have them succeed. And I think that's a big deal. I think a lot of people have great ideas, but they don't succeed in executing on those ideas. And I think that's a big deal. I think it's important to have a high success rate in starting companies. I think that's a big deal. And I think I've been able to do that. And I think that's a big deal. I think it's important to have a high success rate in starting companies. I think that's a big deal. And I think I've been able to do that. And I think that's a big deal."," I was always curious about how things work. And I think that's pretty common. Kids are always asking, ""Why is it like that?"" And I think it's good to just be exposed to a lot of different things. I think I read a lot of books, and my parents took me on a lot of trips. And we went to Canada, and we went to the US, and we went to Mexico, and we went to Europe. And we just saw a lot of different things, and I was exposed to a lot of different cultures, and I think that was helpful. And then, I think, just generally, I was always interested in the future. I thought about the future a lot. And I was always trying to figure out, like, what are the things that would be the things that would affect the future in a big way. And then, I would try to read a lot about those things. And then, I would try to do things in that area.
So, like, one example is, I was trying to figure out what would affect the future in a big way. And I thought, well, the internet is something that's going to be big. And then, I tried to figure out, well, what's the most important thing on the internet? And I thought, well, the most important thing on the internet is going to be the thing that helps you find the most useful information, the fastest. And then, I realized that the way to do that is to figure out what questions you should ask. And then, the answers to those questions would be the most useful information. So then, I worked on a software called 'Questions and Answers' to try to figure out what are the right questions to ask. And then, you connect those questions to the answers. And then, you get better answers by iterating on the questions and the answers. And then, you can also see how other people have answered a question, and you can see how they've ranked relative to other people. And then, you can also see how you rank relative to other people. And so, it's a way of sort of self-improvement, also.
And then, I thought, well, what's the most important question to answer? I think the most important question to answer is, ""What is the nature of the universe?"" And then, I realized that in order to answer the question, what is the nature of the universe, you actually have to answer two questions. One is, what is the nature of physics? And then, what is the meaning of life, or what is the purpose of life? And then, I realized that these are the two hardest questions in the universe. And then, I realized that there was a third question, which is, how can we expand the scope and scale of consciousness? And then, I realized that these were actually the three hardest questions in the universe. And then, I realized that there was actually a fourth question, which is, how can we ensure the future is good, ensure that civilization continues, and that the sort of small candle of consciousness in the void that is humanity continues and that the candle does not go out.",B,B
Mostly not.," I think it depends on what you want to do. If you want to do fundamental research, then a PhD is probably a good idea. If you want to do something that's more practical, then a PhD is probably not a good idea.", I think it's not necessary.,B,B
"Some yes, but mostly not."," I think the way to be useful is to try to understand the world as it is, not as you wish it to be, and to try to take actions that are in the service of the truth.", I don’t know. Useful to who?,B,A
"Well, I think you make some estimates of, whatever this thing is that you're trying to create, what would be the utility delta compared to the current state of the art times how many people it would affect. So that's why I think having something that makes a big difference but affects sort of small to moderate number of people is great, as is something that makes even a small difference but affects a vast number of people. Like, the area under the curve."," I think you should try to do things that you think are useful, and then if they’re not useful, you should stop doing them."," I don’t know. Usefulness is, I think, somewhat overrated. I think the things that really matter are love and beauty and things like that. And if you get into the mindset of trying to be useful, I think you’re going to be pretty sad because you’re going to be — I mean, what is useful anyway? Useful to whom?",B,B
"Yeah, exactly. I mean, the area under the curve would actually be roughly similar for those two things, so it's actually really about just trying to be useful and matter.", Yeah.," Yeah, just have a high leverage.",B,B
"Very crazy. For sure. They were not shy of saying that. But I agreed with them that it was quite crazy. Crazy...if the objective was to achieve the best risk-adjusted return, starting off a company is insane. But that was not my objective. I'd soon come to a conclusion that if something didn't happen to improve rocket technology, we'd be stuck on earth forever. And the big aerospace companies had just had no interest in radical innovation. All they wanted to do was try tomake their old technology slightly better every year. And in fact, sometimes it would actually get worse. Particularly in rockets, it was pretty bad. In '69 we were able to go to the moon with the Saturn 5. And then the space shuttle could onlytake people to low-earth orbit. And then the space shuttle retired. And that trend basically trends to zero. People sometimes think technology just automatically gets better every year but actually it doesn't. It only gets better if smart people work like crazy to make it better. That's how any technology actually gets better. By itself, technology, if people don't work at it, actually will decline. Look at the history of civilizations,many civilizations. Look at, say, ancient Egypt, where they were able to build these incredible pyramids and then they basically forgot how to build pyramids. And even hieroglyphics. They forgot how to read hieroglyphics. Or if you look atRome and how they were able to build these incredible roadways and aqueduct sand indoor plumbing, they forgot how to do all of those things. There are many such examples in history. So I think we should always bear in mind that entropy is not on your side."," Yeah, it was.", Yes.,B,A
"Well, first of all I'd say I actually think I feel fear quite strongly. So it's not as though I just have the absence of fear. I feel it quite strongly. There are just times when something is important enough that you believe in it enough that you do it in spite of fear."," I think it's important to remember that if you're going to do something that's difficult, you're going to be told it's crazy."," I mean, I'm not saying I'm fearless. I mean, I certainly have fear. It's just that the fear is not always stopping me. And I think there's a difference between being afraid and not doing something and not being afraid and doing something. I mean, I certainly have fear. I mean, I'm not sure I'd actually do some of the things I've done if I was not afraid. But I mean, the point at which you have fear and you don't do something, that's one thing. But if you have fear and you do something, that's a different thing.",B,B
"It's like, people shouldn't think, well, ""I feel fear about this and therefore I shouldn't do it,"" it's normal to feel fear. Like, you'd have to have something mentally wrong with you if you don't feel fear."," I mean, I think it's important to be able to take risks and to be able to take risks that are important to you. And I think if you're going to take risks, you should take risks that are important to you."," I mean, I'm not saying I'm right about everything. But I think it's just, there's a lot of things that are important that are not right.",A,A
"Yeah. You know, actually something that can be helpful is fatalism, to some degree. If you just accept the probabilities, then that diminishes fear. When starting SpaceX, I thought the odds of success were less than 10% and I just accepted that actually probably I would just lose everything. But that maybe would make some progress. If we could just move the ball forward, even if we died, maybe some other company could pick up the baton and keep moving it forward, so we'd still do some good. Yeah, same with Tesla. I thought the odds ofa car company succeeding were extremely low.", Yeah., Yeah.,B,A
"Well, oddly enough, I actually think they're pretty good.", I think there's a good chance that we will get to Mars in the next 15 to 20 years.," Well, I mean, the Mars city is, I think, a much more likely outcome than a Mars colony. I think we can have a Mars city, like a self-sustaining city on Mars, in this century. The critical threshold is with the current technology, you can get things to Mars, but you can’t get them back. So, if you have a one-way trip, people are unlikely to go. But if you have a two-way trip, people are more likely to go. And you need a certain amount of infrastructure on Mars before you can have a two-way trip because you need to be able to get back to Earth if something goes wrong on Mars.
So, the Mars city is, I think, very likely in this century. I’d be disappointed if it didn’t happen in this century. And then, the Mars colony is when the per capita income on Mars exceeds that of Earth, and people can afford to go to Mars and live there. That’s probably a much more distant future, but I think we should have a Mars city as a backstop civilization. Just in case something goes wrong on Earth, we have a backstop civilization on Mars. And we should also have a backstop civilization on the Moon. And we’re working on a backstop civilization on the Moon as well with Starship.",B,A
"I hope I'm not in some realm of self-delusion here. But look at it this way: at this point, I'm certain there is a way. I'm certain that success is one of possible outcomes for establishing a self-sustaining Mars colony, a growing Mars colony. I'm certain that is possible. Whereas until maybe a few years ago, I was not sure that success was even one of the possible outcomes. In terms of having some meaningful number of people going to Mars, I think this is potentially something that can be accomplished in about 10 years. Maybe sooner, maybe nine years. Indeed to make sure that SpaceX doesn't die between now and then and that I don't die, or if I do die, that someone takes over who will continue that.", I think you can come back.," Well, I think we should really try hard to make it happen in this century; before the end of the century.",B,B
"Yeah, exactly. The first launch will be robotic anyway.", I'm not going on the first launch., I will go on the first launch.,A,A
"Yeah, the internet latency would be pretty significant. Mars is roughly 12 light minutes from the sun and Earth is 8 light minutes. So, the closest approach to Mass is four light minutes away. The furthest approach is 20. A little more because you can't sort of talk directly through the sun."," Yeah, the latency is a problem."," Yeah, it’s going to be great.",A,A
"Okay, I mean I do want to emphasize that this is not really something that I advocate or this is not prescriptive. This is simply, hopefully, predictive. Because you will hear some say, well, like this is something that I want to occur instead of this is something I think that probably is the best of the available alternatives. The best of the available alternatives that I can come up with, and maybe someone else can come up with a better approach or better outcome, is that we achieve democratization of AI technology. Meaning that no one company or small set of individuals has control over advanced AI technology. I think that's very dangerous. It could also get stolen by somebody bad, like some evil dictator or country could send their intelligence agency to go steal it and gain control. It just becomes a very unstable situation, I think, if you've got any incredibly powerful AI. You just don't know who's going to control that. So it's not that I think that the risk is that the AI would develop a will of its own right off the bat. I think the concern is that someone may use it in a way that is bad. Or even if they weren't going to use it in a way that's bad but somebody could take it from them and use it in a way that's bad, that, I think, is quite a big danger. So I think we must have democratization of AI technology to make it widely available. And that's the reason that obviously you, me, and the rest of the team created OpenAI was to help spread out AI technology so it doesn't get concentrated in the hands of a few. But then, of course, that needs to be combined with solving the high-bandwidth interface to the cortex.", I think we should take the actions necessary to ensure that AI is a force for good. I think we should take the actions necessary to ensure that AI is a force for good.," I’m optimistic about AI. I think it will be the case that AI will be able to understand the world better than humans and will be able to take actions in the world better than humans. Now, the point at which an AI can do something that a human cannot do to stop it, that’s where things get spooky. But I think the probability of an AI dystopian outcome is actually quite low.",B,B
"Humans are so slow. Yes, exactly. But we already have a situation in ourb rain where we've got the cortex and the limbic system... The limbic system is kind of a...I mean, that's the primitive brain. That's kind of like your instincts and whatnot. And the cortex is the thinking upper part of the brain. Those two seem to work together quite well. Occasionally, your cortex and limbic system will disagree, but they..."," Yeah, we're so slow."," Yeah, we're really slow.",B,A
"Generally works pretty well, and it's like rare to find someone who...I've notfound someone wishes to either get rid of the cortex or get rid of the limbic system.", It generally works pretty well.," Yes, it does. Most of the time, they're in agreement.",A,A
"Yeah, that's unusual. So I think if we can effectively merge with AI by improving the neural link between your cortex and your digital extension of yourself, which already, like I said, already exists, just has a bandwidth issue. And then effectively you become an AI-human symbiote. And if that then is widespread, with anyone who wants it can have it, then we solve the control problem as well, we don't have to worry about some evil dictator AI because we are the AI collectively. That seems like the best outcome I can think of."," It's like, okay, we're going to keep those.", People are generally pretty happy with their mind and their body.,B,B
I think it's going pretty well. I think we've got a really talented group at OpenAI., I think they're doing great., I think OpenAI is doing great.,B,B
"Yeah, a really talented team and they're working hard. OpenAI is structured as a 501(c)(3) non-profit. But many non-profits do not have a sense of urgency. It's fine, they don't have to have a sense of urgency, but OpenAI does because I think people really believe in the mission. I think it's important. And it's about minimizing the risk of existential harm in the future. And so I think it's going well. I'm pretty impressed with what people are doing and the talent level. And obviously, we're always looking for great people to join in the mission.", Yeah.," Yeah, it seems like it.",B,B
"My time is mostly split between SpaceX and Tesla. And of course, I try to spend a part of every week at OpenAI. So I spend basically half a day at OpenAI most weeks. And then I have some OpenAI stuff that happens during the week.But other than that, it's really SpaceX and Tesla.", I spend a lot of time at the factory. I'm there most days. I'm there every day. I'm there every day.," Well, it's changed quite a lot over time. I used to spend a lot of time on SpaceX and Tesla, and now I spend most of my time on Neuralink and Twitter. And, in fact, those two full-time, and then I have some free time. And I also still have some stock options that vest in Tesla and SpaceX, and I still go to the Tesla and SpaceX factories on occasion and just work on things. I'm not formally the CEO of Tesla or SpaceX anymore, but I still have a lot of respect for the people there and I still want to help make the products better. So I go and give them feedback and help with product design and that kind of thing.
But Twitter and Neuralink are taking up most of my time. And I'm also studying a lot. I'm trying to learn a lot of things. I hired a tutor to help me learn quantum mechanics. I'm trying to learn more about artificial intelligence. I'm reading a lot of books on philosophy and history. And just trying to be useful and do good for the future.",A,A
"Yes, it's a good question. I think a lot of people think I must spend a lot of time with media or on businessy things. But actually almost all my time, like 80% of it, is spent on engineering and design. Engineering and design, so it's developing next-generation product. That's 80% of it."," Well, I mean, I'm not sure how to describe it. I mean, I guess I'm just trying to make sure that the companies are successful. And I think we're making good progress on that front."," Well, at Tesla, I spend a lot of time on engineering and manufacturing. So I'm out on the factory floor a lot. I think that's really important. I spend a lot of time with the engineering team. I'm not out there as much at SpaceX because it's in South Texas. It's about an hour's flight from here. So I go there probably once a week. And then at Tesla, I'm usually there all day.",B,B
"Yeah. I think a lot of people think I'm kind of a business person or something, which is fine. Business is fine. But really it's like at SpaceX, Gwynne Shotwell is Chief Operating Officer. She manages legal, finance, sales, and general business activity. And then my time is almost entirely with the engineering team, working on improving the Falcon 9 and our Dragon spacecraft and developing the Mars Colonial architecture. At Tesla, it's working on the Model3 and, yeah, so I'm in the design studio, take up a half a day a week, dealing with aesthetics and look-and-feel things. And then most of the rest of the week is just going through engineering of the car itself as well as engineering of the factory. Because the biggest epiphany I've had this year is that what really matters is the machine that builds the machine, the factory. And that is at least two orders of magnitude harder than the vehicle itself.", I'm an engineer., I was obsessed. I still am obsessed.,B,B
"Yeah. Now, this actually has a relatively lower level of automation compared to what the Gigafactory will have and what Model 3 will have.", Yeah., It's like magic.,A,A
"Actually our speed on the line is incredibly slow. I think we are...in terms of the extra velocity of vehicles on the line, it's probably about, including both X andS, it's maybe five centimeters per second. This is very slow.", I think it's 200 a minute.," Well, it’s about 100 cars a day.",B,B
"I'm confident we can get to at least one meter per second. So, a 20-fold increase.", I think we could probably go to 100 kilometers an hour.," Well, I think, you know, just have the cars just go, go, go. The only time they stop is when they go through the automated parking, and even in the automated parking, we’re getting it to the point where it can just, you know, do a high-speed, high-precision parking.",A,A
"Yeah. At least. I mean, I think quite a...one meter per second, just to put into perspective, is a slow walk or a medium-speed walk. A fast walk could be one and a half meters per second. And then the fastest humans can run over 10 meters per second.", Yes.," Yes, it's very fast.",B,B
Elon Musk:What’s Twitter?, I’ve made many mistakes., I’ve made many mistakes.,B,A
"Well, I tweet interesting things pretty much as they come to me, and probably with not much of a filter."," Well, I mean, I think Twitter is a good way to get a sense of what’s going on in the world. I think it’s a good way to get a sense of what’s going on in the world."," Well, I think I have an unhealthy relationship with Twitter. I think I should probably use it less. But I do enjoy using Twitter. I think it’s a fun thing. I mean, I’ve been asked, “Why do you use Twitter?” And I’m like, “It’s like, I just like the taste of it.” I think it’s good. I think it’s fun. I like interacting with people on Twitter. I know it’s a lot of people that tweet at me, and there’s a lot of negative feedback, but there’s also a lot of positive feedback, and a lot of people who enjoy interacting with each other on Twitter.
So I think it’s good. I think it’s fun. I do want to say, I have been told that my feedback loop is too strong, where I get too much feedback. I’m trying to, you know, work on that. Because I think it is actually a bit of an issue. I get too much feedback.",A,A
"I find it entertaining. I think, “Oh, other people might find this entertaining.” Sometimes they do.", I think it’s a good way to communicate with people., I think it’s a good way to get a message out.,B,A
Yeah. Mostly at home. I spend a lot less time on Twitter than people probably think. It’s like maybe 10-15 minutes or something., Yeah.," Yeah, it’s kind of like a fun thing to do. I do it for fun.",A,B
"Yeah. It’s pretty interesting what my most ... What people are most interested in, like some little tweet about “I love anime.” That was it. But it was lowercase “i”, black heart, “anime,” and people loved that. That was like one of my most popular tweets.", Yeah.," Yeah, but I mean, I think there’s a lot of people that are on Twitter that are not exactly normal.",A,B
Not really. I think it’s mostly just if it’s something that might cause a substantial movement in the stock during trading hours. That’s about it.," I mean, I’m not going to change my Twitter behavior. I’m going to be me.", I think I have to be more positive.,A,A
"I look at it as a way to learn things, kinda stay in touch with what’s happening. It feels like dipping into the flow of consciousness of society. That’s what it feels like. It’s kinda weird. I guess I sometimes use Twitter to express myself, and that’s a weird thing to do, I suppose."," Yeah, I mean, I think it’s a good way to communicate with people.", I think it’s a way to get a message out.,A,A
Some people use their hair to express themselves. I use Twitter.," Yeah. I mean, I think it’s a good way to express yourself. I mean, I think it’s a good way to express yourself. I mean, I think it’s a good way to express yourself. I mean, I think it’s a good way to express yourself."," I’m trying to think of a good analogy for Twitter. It’s a bit like a psych ward. You’ve got a bunch of people that are in the psych ward. Some of them are a little bit crazy, some of them are a little bit crazy, and some of them are just normal people that are in the psych ward because they’re having a tough time. And then there’s the doctors and nurses, which are the people that are actually posting on Twitter.",B,B
"Well, I have to say, my regard for the press has dropped quite dramatically."," I mean, I think I’ve been pretty clear that I don’t like censorship."," I mean, I don’t start them all. But there’s a lot of people on Twitter. It’s over 200 million people.",A,A
"The amount of untruthful stuff that is written is unbelievable. Takethat Wall Street Journal front-page articleabout, like, “The FBI is closing in.” That is utterly false. That’s absurd. To print such a falsehood on the front page of a major newspaper is outrageous. Like, why are they even journalists? They’re terrible. Terrible people."," Well, I think the press has been very dishonest."," I think the press often is sloppy and is, in my experience, more interested in getting a scoop than in the truth. And I think that this is a problem. And I think that there’s an over-reliance on anonymous sources and an over-reliance on what I think are basically leaks. And that’s not good.",B,A
"The answer is for the press to be honest and truthful, and research their articles and correct things properly when they are false. Which they don’t do.", I’m not attacking the press. I’m attacking falsehoods., I’m literally asking for one example of that and you can’t name one.,A,A
"Yes, of course I do.", I understand that there are some people who don’t like the press., I understand that people will take advantage of any situation. That’s human nature.,B,A
I suggest the press take it to heart and do better., I think we’re going to be fine. I think we’re going to be fine., I think we’re already in a dangerous cycle.,B,B
No., I think the media is the enemy of the people.," I think we’re not the enemy of the people, but he doesn’t like negative news.",B,A
"Yeah. There are good journalists and there are bad ones, and unfortunately the feedback loop for good versus bad is inverted, so the more salacious that an article is, the more salacious the headline is, the more clicks it’s gonna get. Then somebody is not a journalist, they are an ad salesman.", I’m not saying that I like Donald Trump. I’m not saying that. I’m just saying that I think we should take the sort of a principle of the sort of the sort of the sort of the sort of the sort of the sort of the sort of the sort of the sort of the sort of the sort

Ford and Tesla made it barely through the last recession. There’s a good chance Ford doesn’t make it in the next recession.

And so"," I mean, I think it’s fair to say that Tesla has probably accelerated the advent of sustainable energy by at least five or six years.",B,B
"Yes. It sort of blows my mind, all these social justice warriors driving around in diesel cars. It’s outrageous.", Yes.," Yeah, sustainable energy, sustainable transportation.",B,A
"No, I think the electrification of transport, and there’s also an important part of Tesla which is solar and stationary batteries, because you need to generate electricity in a standard, sustainable way with solar and then store it at night when the sun goes down with batteries, and then use that energy from the sun to power cars. Without Tesla, this would still happen. There would still be a transition to sustainable energy, but it would take much longer. History will judge this, obviously, but I would say on the order of 10 years, maybe 20 years."," I mean, I think we should take the actions that are most likely to make the future better.", I’m not a cartoon character.,A,A
"Yes. I think it’s probably fair to say that Tesla has advanced sustainable energy by at least five years, conservatively, and maybe closer to 10, and then if we continue to make progress, we might advance it by 20 years. This could be all the difference in the world.", Yeah.," Yeah, maybe five years.",B,B
"It’s been terrible. This year felt like five years of aging, frankly. The worst year of my entire career. Insanely painful."," Well, I think we’ve been doing a good job of taking care of our employees. I think we’ve been doing a good job of taking care of the community. We’ve been doing a lot of things to help the community. We’ve been doing a lot of things to help our suppliers. We’ve been doing a lot of things to help our customers. I think we’ve been doing a good job of taking care of the world."," Yeah, it’s been quite stressful. I think we’ve all aged a lot in a short period of time. It’s been very intense. But I think we’ve gotten through it. I think we’re on the other side of it now. So I think things will calm down a bit. They will be more normal. I think there was a lot of abnormality that we’re all operating at very high stress and working incredibly hard. But things are starting to normalize, and I think they’ll be back to relatively normal in a few months.",B,B
"For this past year, it’s been because of the Model 3 production ramp. Myself and others at Tesla, we had to go in and fix the mistakes in the Model 3 production system, and there were a lot of them. I personally solved a bunch. Jerome [Guillen] solved a bunch. Everyone helped, the entire team. Javier [Verdura], Franz [von Holzhausen], Deepak [Ahuja], everyone. It was ... like, we had the legal team delivering cars in Q3. Todd [Maron] is great. There was a lot of people ... Everyone had to basically go hardcore to solve the ramp.", I think it was going to happen this year or next year. I think it was going to happen.," I mean, it was going to happen in 2023, and then it got moved to 2022. It’s not like I was trying to make it happen in 2022. It was just, the investors who were planning to leave in 2023, they moved it up to 2022.",B,B
"Yeah, there’s no question there’s, like, self-inflicted wounds. In fact, my brother said, “Look, if you do a self-inflicted wound, can you at least not twist the knife afterwards?” You stabbed yourself in the leg. You don’t really need to twist it in your leg. Why do that?", I think we’re doing the right thing. I think we’re doing the right thing.," I mean, I think I’ve done a good job of running Tesla. We’ve created a lot of value for the shareholders. The Tesla stock price has increased, I think, 500% since I took over as CEO. So I think it’s fair to say that I’ve done a good job of running Tesla.",B,A
"It’s not intentional. Sometimes you’re just under a lot of pressure, and you’re not getting much sleep, you’re under massive pressure, and you make mistakes.", I don’t know. I think I’ve learned a lot. I think I’ve learned a lot.," I don’t know. I was in a bad mind state. I’m not going to blame it on DMT, but I was definitely experiencing some negative effects there. I think if you’re going to do DMT, you want to be in a good mind state and you want to have a guide, a shaman, and you want to be in a safe environment. And you don’t want to be taking DMT and then decide to go ‘oh, I’m going to launch a rocket’ or something like that. It’s not a good idea. So I was, unfortunately, in a negative frame of mind and took some DMT. And then it just spiraled downhill from there. I don’t know what the DMT did, but it certainly was not helpful.",B,B
It’s totally over. I will never make another mistake again., I think I’m calmer. I think I’m calmer.," Yes, I do.

"Yeah. Things are back to a hard work schedule, but not an insane work schedule. I was, there were times when, some weeks ... I don’t know. I haven’t counted exactly, but I would just sort of sleep for a few hours, work, sleep for a few hours, work, seven days a week. Some of those days must have been 120 hours or something nutty.

Yeah. It’s not like for fun or something., Yeah. I don’t use Ambien anymore.," Yeah, yeah.",B,B
"No, it’s just like, if you’re super-stressed, you can’t go to sleep. You either have a choice of, like, okay, I’ll have zero sleep and then my brain won’t work tomorrow, or you’re gonna take some kind of sleep medication to fall asleep."," It’s like, I’m trying to get some sleep here."," I mean, I think it’s pretty dangerous to drive if you’re not getting enough sleep. And I think people should be more careful about driving when they’re tired. That’s a big problem. And, you know, we have autopilot. So, you can at least stay awake and then use autopilot.",B,B
"I think at Tesla we’re doing pretty well right now. Tesla’s not staring death in the face. We’re in, I think, a pretty good position. We don’t want to be complacent, but it’s not ... Up until around September, we were really faced with, like, “We must solve this or we’re gonna die,” constantly. I feel like we’re no longer in the staring-death-in-the-face situation."," Well, I think we’re going to make a lot of cars. I think we’re going to make about 5,000 cars a week."," I think we’re going to be able to make a lot of cars. I think we could make, like, 70,000 units this quarter if we wanted to.",B,A
"Well, you never want to get complacent, so we still need to work hard, but I think we’re over the hump. We’re certainly over the hump on Model 3 production. For us, making 5,000 cars in a week for Model 3 is not a big deal. That’s just normal. Now we’re working on raising to 6,000 and then 7,000 Model 3s a week, while still keeping costs under control. We could probably do 6,000 or more, maybe 6,500 Model 3s a week right now, but it would have to stress people out and do tons of overtime.", Yeah.," Exactly. So, it’s not like we’re in any danger of going out of business or anything like that. But there are a bunch of things that we want to do that are important. Like, we really want to make the Model 3 as affordable as possible. That’s a really important goal. And we want to try to make the Model 3 the best car in the world. So, we’re going to keep working on that.
And we want to try to get the Model Y program started and get an affordable SUV, a small SUV, started. And we want to try to accelerate the transition to sustainable energy. I think it’s really going to be important for the future of civilization to accelerate the transition to sustainable energy. The advent of sustainable energy is really just a matter of time, but it’s sort of like, you know, under current circumstances, it takes on the order of 30 to 40 years.
But we want to try to really get that to happen much sooner than that. Like, maybe it happens like 10 or 20 years from now, but we want to try to really get the ball rolling on that. And then, we want to try to help solve the existential crisis that is artificial general intelligence. So, we’re going to try to really make sure that we do everything we can to ensure that AGI is a good thing and that it is not a risk to humanity.",B,B
Drive on Navigation?," Yeah, so we’ve got a new navigation system that’s coming out. It’s really great. It’s got a bunch of new features. It’s got real-time traffic, real-time road construction, and it’s got a new map. The map is much better. It’s got a lot more detail. It’s got a lot more information. It’s got a lot more points of interest. It’s got a lot more data. It’s got a lot more data."," Sure. So, we’ve just released the navigation feature for Model 3. It’s using only cameras and GPS. There’s no LIDAR or radar being used for the navigation. This is just using passive optical, which is similar to what Google Maps or Waze is using. This is really, I think, a major breakthrough in the space.

"That’s I think one of the first major steps toward full self-driving. You can enter in an address, and from highway on-ramp to highway off-ramp, the car will change lanes. It will go from one highway to the next automatically, and take off-ramp automatically. It’s pretty wild. It’ll overtake a slow car. It’s basically integrating navigation with the Autopilot capability. That’s why we call it Navigate on Autopilot, or Drive on Nav.", It’s pretty good.," So, it’ll just drive you where you want to go, and then park.",B,B
"Well, the main challenge has been improving the neural net so that we can recognize all types of objects from all eight cameras. There are eight cameras: Three forward, two on each side, and one rear. The big challenge has been solving a wide range of corner cases. So if you have a —"," Well, I think the biggest thing is that the car needs to be able to handle any situation that a person can handle. So, it’s not like the car is going to be perfect. It’s going to make mistakes. But the car needs to be able to handle any situation that a person can handle. And then, it needs to be able to learn from those mistakes and improve."," Well, I mean, the battle for the driverless future is far from over. The industry is moving towards driverless, but I think it’s moving too slowly. I think we should accelerate the move to driverless. The safety statistics for people driving their own cars are horrific. So many people die in car accidents, and most of them are preventable. So, if we can get to driverless sooner, we can save a lot of lives. So, that’s what we’re trying to do here at Tesla is to accelerate the advent of driverless.",B,A
"Yeah, the roads are pretty messy, so you could have, say, skid marks on the road that look like a line. Sometimes tar seams look like a line. Sometimes the lines are just painted wrong, for some reason. One of our biggest challenges, actually, with Drive on Navigation was dealing with forks and gores, where if a lane is splitting, you need to be confident that you’re going either left or right, not down the center. And the car will come to a halt at the first intersection.
Now we’re integrating stop signs, traffic lights, being able to do, say, hard right turns or hairpin bends and that kind of thing.", Yeah.," Yeah, so you can’t really anticipate all the corner cases. So, you have to just have a neural net that’s capable enough to handle a wide range of corner cases. So, it’s really just a lot of testing and then adjusting the neural net to handle more and more edge cases.",B,B
"Yeah, we’re not really thinking about it. We’re assuming that there won’t be —", I think we’ll be able to do it without any regulations.," No, we’re not thinking about it. I think, you know, the car is designed to be able to navigate with just cameras. No LIDAR, no radar, just cameras. And we’re confident that it will be able to navigate even in bad weather, like heavy rain, heavy fog, and so forth.",B,B
"No. The car needs to drive better than a human driver using the same inputs as a human driver. Eyes are basically just cameras. All creatures on Earth navigate with cameras. A fish eagle can see a fish from far away and take into account the refractive index of the water, dive down and get the fish from far away. There’s no question that image-recognition neural nets and cameras, you can be superhuman at driving with just cameras.", I’m not assuming. I’m saying we’re not thinking about it., I’m saying we’re not thinking about it right now.,B,A
"Yeah, that’s hopeless. That would, at best, be a specialized solution, and whatever city puts stuff in roads ... You can always make something work for a specific solution, like some special-case solution in some town, you can make that easy, but what you really want is a general solution for self-driving that works worldwide.
I’d love you to sort of assess the competitive landscape.Faraday just lost another founder today, which was the hot company, or the allegedly hot company, I think that’s probably easier to say it that way.Lucid got a billion dollars.How do you assess — Google’s working on stuff, Uber still seems to be hanging in there. I’d love to get your assessment of all of them.
Yeah. I don’t really think that much about competitors. I just say like, you know, how do we make our cars as good as possible? How do we make sure we have like the best engineering and manufacturing talent in the world?
It’s sort of like the old adage with, you know, running ... If you start looking at the other runners, it’s not good, you know. Like, you can lose races because of that.", That’s stupid., You don’t need it.,B,A
"Self-driving, maybe Google, Waymo? I don’t think anyone is close to Tesla in terms of achieving a general solution for working on —", I don’t know. I don’t think about it., I don’t know. I don’t think anyone’s really working on self-driving at a very high level of capability. I think we’re probably the only ones who are even trying to do self-driving at an acceptable level. I think everyone else is just trying to put some sensors in cars and call it autonomy.,B,B
"Yeah. Yeah. You can definitely make things work like in one particular city or something like that by special-casing it, but in order to work, you know, all around the world in all these different countries where there’s, like, different road signs, different traffic behavior, there’s like every weird corner case you can imagine. You really have to have a generalized solution. And best to my knowledge, no one has a good generalized solution except ... and I think no one is likely to achieve a generalized solution to self-driving before Tesla. I could be surprised, but...", Yeah.," Yeah, overall solution. I mean, we’re not trying to keep it a secret, so.",B,B
No., None of the car companies.," None of them. I think they’re all, frankly, they’re all kind of like… they’re not even trying that hard. They’re just assuming that Tesla will solve it for them.",B,A
"The other car companies ... I don’t wanna sound overconfident, but I would be very surprised if any of the car companies exceeded Tesla in self-driving, in getting to full self-driving.
You know, I think we’ll get to full self-driving next year. As a generalized solution, I think. But that’s a ... Like, we’re on track to do that next year. So I don’t know. I don’t think anyone else is on track to do it next year."," I mean, I think they’re doing some good things."," Yeah, sure. Well, I mean, there’s…",B,A
"They might have sold it, I don’t know.", They’re not an investor., I don’t own any Tesla stock.,B,A
"You know ... I mean, as I said earlier this year, I think we will be cash-flow positive for all quarters going forward."," Well, I mean, we’re going to have to raise more money. I think we’re going to have to raise money from the public. I think we’re going to have to have a public offering of some kind. I don’t know if it’s a traditional IPO or something else, but we’re going to have to raise money from the public. And I think we’re going to have to do that as soon as possible."," I mean, we’ve been profitable for the last three quarters. So it’s not like we’re burning through some crazy amount of money. I mean, we’re not a company that is in any danger of going out of business. I mean, we have $1.5 billion in the bank, and we’re profitable. So this idea that there’s some sort of financial constraint on us is not true.
But in order to grow the company, it is necessary to increase the amount of capital that the company has. And there are really two ways to increase the amount of capital a company has. One is to increase the amount of money that the company earns, and the other is to increase the amount of money that is invested in the company. And there’s really two ways to increase the amount that the company earns. One is to increase the number of cars and trucks that we produce, and the number of spacecraft that we build, and the number of satellites that we launch, and the number of Starlink terminals that we sell.
And then the other is to improve the efficiency of the company. I think a lot of people don’t appreciate how hard it is to improve the efficiency of a company. It’s incredibly difficult. It’s much harder than making more stuff. Making more stuff is hard, but making something that doesn’t exist before is much harder than making more of something that already exists. But improving the efficiency of the company, there are just so many things that you have to keep in mind.
First of all, you have to make sure that the company is not starving for money. If the company is starving for money, the company will die of starvation before it can be efficient. So you have to make sure that the company is not starving. Then you have to make sure that the company is not suffering from low morale. If the company is suffering from low morale, it’s going to be very difficult to improve the efficiency of the company. So you have to make sure that the morale is high.
Then you have to make sure that the company is not suffering from low motivation. If the company is not motivated, it’s very difficult to improve the efficiency. Then you have to make sure that the company is not suffering from low productivity. If the company is not productive, it’s very difficult to improve the efficiency. Then you have to make sure that the company is not suffering from low quality. If the company is not making high quality products, it’s very difficult to improve the efficiency.
So there’s just so many things that you have to keep in mind in order to improve the efficiency of the company, and then you have to actually do it. And then, even if you improve the efficiency, but you don’t use that improved efficiency to make more products or provide better service, then nothing will happen. So you have to actually use the improved efficiency to make more products or provide better service.
So I would say that improving the efficiency of a company is probably ten times harder than making more stuff. But it is important to do both. And I think we’ve been doing both. I think we’ve been doing it very well. And we’re going to keep doing it. And I think we’re going to keep improving the efficiency of the company and making more products.
And then, in terms of increasing the amount of money that is invested in the company, I think it’s important to appreciate that there’s a big difference between the money that is invested in a company and the money that a company earns. The money that a company earns is many times more than the money that is invested in the company. So if a company earns $100 billion a year, and $1 billion was invested in the company, that $1 billion investment will result in $100 billion of earnings.",B,A
"No, I don’t think so.", I think we will be cash-flow positive for all quarters going forward., No.,B,B
We don’t need to go private. I think we could execute better if we were private.," I don’t know. I mean, I think we’re going to have to do something to go private. I mean, we’re going to have to do something to not be publicly traded. I don’t know what that is. I think we’re going to have to do something."," No, I’m not planning to go private.",A,A
"Yeah, you know, not to harp on those short-sellers, because people think I have this obsession with them, but I spent like 1 percent [or] less of time thinking about them —", Yeah.," Yeah, I mean, I think it’s pretty great that Tesla is a public company and that people can buy our stock if they want or don’t buy our stock if they don’t want. I think that’s pretty great. And we have a lot of institutional investors and we have a lot of retail investors, and I think that’s also good. It’s kind of important that we don’t just have a bunch of people who are just institutional investors because then they could just, you know, “We don’t like the way Tesla’s run. We’re going to sell it and buy something else.” Well, okay, that’s up to them, but it’s also up to the retail investors to decide whether they want to buy Tesla or not. And if they don’t like how it’s run, then they shouldn’t buy it.
And we’ve got a lot of retail investors. I mean, there are a lot of people who have, you know, $500 or $1,000 in Tesla stock, and that’s pretty cool. I think that’s a good thing. And then it’s also good to have institutional investors because they have a lot of money and they can help us grow. And some of them have very good ideas.
I mean, one of the things that is actually quite helpful is that we have a lot of institutional investors who are pension funds and things that have a long-term time horizon. And some of them are actually quite good at, you know, value investing and stuff. And they’ll say, “Okay, we’re not going to sell Tesla just because the stock price went up or down. And we’re going to look at Tesla on a long-term basis and say, is Tesla doing good or bad?”
And I think that’s actually pretty helpful because sometimes the public market can get a little too much into the short-term. And then also, it’s good to have the short-term and the long-term. I think it’s actually pretty good that we have that. And also, we have a lot of retail investors who are just people who just believe in Tesla or think that what we’re doing is good.
And sometimes the retail investors are actually better than the institutional investors because they just believe in Tesla because they think it’s cool or because they think it’s good for the world, or they just like cars. And they’re not just doing it because it’s some sort of a spreadsheet analysis. And that’s actually pretty great, too. I think it’s good to have a variety of people that have a variety of time horizons and for different reasons are owning Tesla stock.",B,A
"Less than 1 percent of my tweets have anything to do with short-sellers. But the issue is that there’s a group of people who are quite smart, very mean, and have a strong financial interest in Tesla’s downfall.
And what that results in is a constant attack on the Tesla brand, on me personally, on the executive team, on our cars. You know, every mistake we make is amplified.
Going private would definitely result in some short-term drama. Let’s say we’re private, and then we went public five years from now. Then the area under the curve of brand damage by short-sellers would be probably less than the short-term difficulty of going private in the first place. That was the approximate calculus.
And then also being public, particularly when everyone at the company is a shareholder, causes a lot of distraction when the share price moves around a lot. It tends to end up being like a mood, to some degree, a mood thermometer. So it’s like the stock goes down, people are sad and feel undercompensated. And then when the stock goes up, people are exuberant, overly exuberant, and you get distracted thinking about what you’re going to buy."," And I’m like, “Why are they so obsessed with me?”"," Yeah, I mean, I don’t really think about them that much. But there’s a lot of people who really are obsessed with short-selling, and they read all the books on it. And they just think about it all day. And there’s some of them that are long-term followers, and they think that I have some sort of obsession with short-selling. And I’m like, „Look, man, I couldn’t care less about short-selling.“",B,A
"So, like, neither of these things are great. When you have big moves in the stock, this just causes a distraction."," So it’s like, okay, well, if we’re private, then the mood of the company is not going to be so affected by the stock price."," So I think there’s a lot of good things about being public, and there’s some things that are difficult. But I think, on balance, I think it’s probably good to be public.",A,A

"No, hovercrafts are pretty straightforward."," I mean, I think we can do a better job of that."," Well, the thing is that there is a design that can do supersonic vertical takeoff and landing. And then, the thing is that it’s very difficult to do supersonic because you have a shockwave. And then, if you’re going to transition to level flight, you have to transition through the shockwave, which is very difficult. It’s like a turbulent flow. It’s very difficult.",B,A
"A supersonic vertical-takeoff-and-landing electric jet would be interesting to do at some point, I think. But my head would definitely explode if I tried to do that right now.
But I’ve been thinking about that design for nine years. It’s great.", Yeah., Not for you.,B,B

"I think it’s literally the most exciting product lineup of any company in the world. Certainly from a consumer standpoint. I’ll just go through the things that are publicly announced.
You’ve got the Model Y, which is the midsize SUV. You’ve got the Semi truck, which is, can be great for really heavy transport. It’ll be like the heaviest class of truck, of industrial truck.
We’ve got the next-generation Roadster. Which will be the fastest sports car on every dimension. Fastest acceleration, fastest top speed, best handling. It’s important to have an electric sports car that’s faster than the fastest gasoline sports car. And it helps address that halo effect that gasoline sports cars have. So I think it’s important to do that to show that, you know, electric is the best architecture.
Then we’ve got the pickup truck, which — actually, I’m personally most excited about the pickup truck."," Well, I think we’ll do the Roadster next year."," Well, I can’t say exactly when, but we do want to get back to production as soon as possible. I think I’ve said before it’s probably on the order of maybe a year or something like that. We really want to get back to production as soon as possible. I think we’ve learned a lot of lessons along the way, and I think we can get it done much more efficiently, much faster, and with a much better product. So I think people will be pretty excited when they see what we’re planning for the Roadster.",B,A
"Well I can’t talk about the details, but it’s gonna be like a really futuristic-like cyberpunk, “Blade Runner” pickup truck. It’s gonna be awesome, it’s gonna be amazing. This will be heart-stopping. It stops my heart. It’s like, oh, it’s great."," Well, I’ve always wanted to make a pickup truck. I mean, I’ve driven a lot of pickup trucks. I’ve driven a lot of them. And I’ve always wanted to make a pickup truck. And I think we can make a pickup truck that’s better than anything else."," Well, I grew up in the truck. My father had a truck, and I spent a lot of time in the truck. And I thought it’d be cool to have a truck that was electric. And I think it’s got to have a utility body. It’s got to be able to carry stuff. And it’s got to be able to tow stuff. And it’s got to have a lot of torque. So that’s like the things that are important for a truck. And I think we’re going to have some pretty cool features on the truck that are not present on other trucks.",B,A

"It’s something I’ve been wanting to make for a long time. If there’s only a small number of people that like that truck, I guess we’ll make a more conventional truck in the future.

So, you can’t tell the difference."," Yeah, they’re like solar glass tiles.",B,A
"And even when you do accelerated lab testing on a solar roof, it still takes a while. And we’ve gotta put a lot of work into making the installation process easy, so it doesn’t take ages to install a roof.
Then we’ve got the Powerwall battery storage system. We’ve got the Powerpack, which is used for utilities on industrial scale. We’re gonna have some other exciting announcements on the stationary storage front. So when you —"," And, you know, go through all kinds of weather."," So, it’s a long-term investment. But it’s going to be great. And, in fact, we’re going to start using it on our own roofs. So, we’re going to start using it at SpaceX, Tesla, and the Boring Company. And, in fact, we’ll be using it at the Gigafactory for the solar glass roof tiles. So, we’ll be using the product that we’re developing at the Gigafactory.",B,B

"We successfully launched the Falcon Heavy rocket, which is the most powerful rocket in the world by a factor of two. So that’s twice the power, twice the thrust of the next biggest rocket. And we actually launched a Tesla —myTesla Roadster — to Mars orbit. The reason we did that is actually because, normally, when a new rocket is launched, you just put a dummy payload, which is like a block of concrete or something."," Well, we’re trying to make life multi-planetary. So we’re working on a rocket called the Starship, which is designed to take large numbers of people to Mars and to the Moon and to anywhere in the solar system. And we’re also working on a rocket called the Falcon 9, which is designed to take small satellites to orbit. And we’re also working on a rocket called the Falcon Heavy, which is designed to take large satellites to orbit."," Well, we’re trying to make the rockets reusable. This is fundamental. The cost of reusability needs to be factored into the rocket design from the beginning. And we’re making good progress on that front.

"2010 or something like that? Since then, the United States has relied upon the Russian Soyuz, which actually recently has had some issues.
What do you think ofthe Space Force? The Trump Space Force?
Well, this may be a little controversial, but I actually like the idea. I think it’s cool. You know, like, when the Air Force was formed, there was a lot of like pooh-poohing, and like, “Oh, how silly to have an Air Force!” You know, because the aircraft in World War II were managed by the Army."," Yeah, it’s been a while.", It’s been a long time.,A,A
"And so you had the Army and the Navy and the Coast Guard and the Marines, and then ... it became pretty obvious that you really needed a specialized division to manage aircraft. And so the Air Force was created.
And people today may not realize back then it was wildly panned as a ridiculous thing to create the Air Force, but now everyone’s like, “Obviously, you should have an Air Force.” And I think it’s gonna become obvious that we should have a Space Force, too."," And then, the Air Force was formed, and it was like, “Oh, okay, this is a good idea.” So, I think the same thing will happen with the Space Force. It’s like, “Oh, okay, this is a good idea.”"," And they were kind of an afterthought. And the people that were in charge of the Air Force at the time, they were not happy about it. They thought it was a dumb idea. And they were wrong. They were very wrong. So, I think, in general, if you give an organization a clear set of objectives and give it the resources to do those objectives, then that organization will be successful. And if you don’t do that, then the organization will not be successful.
So, I think, if you say, “Okay, we want to have a focus on getting people to Mars and to the Moon and to wherever else we want to go in the solar system,” and you give that organization the resources and a clear objective, then I think that that organization will be successful. And if you don’t do that, then they will not be successful.",B,A
"You know, it’s basically defense in space. And then I think also it could be pretty helpful for maybe expanding our civilization ... You know, expanding things beyond Earth.

And if you say, “Well, what is the sort of mass of a satellite that can actually do something useful?” It’s probably around 500 kilograms. So you’ve got five million kilograms of space, so far, and 2,000 satellites.
I think we need a lot more satellites doing a lot more things. And we need to have a lot of backup systems because we have seen two failures of satellites that are critical to the United States.

"Yeah, Eric’s been really supportive of our activity in L.A. I mean, technically, our first tunnels are in Hawthorne. But we do expect to, over time, create a network of tunnels under greater L.A. And I think this is really the key to getting around the city very fast. You’ve got to go 3-D. Our offices are 3-D and dense, but we then have a 2-D road transport network."," Yeah, exactly. So we’re going to do a test tunnel in LA. It’s going to be about a mile long, and we’re going to do it in the space of about a year. And then we’ll do a demonstration vehicle, and then we’ll do sort of a full-on production vehicle. And then we’ll do it in other places.
So the first one will be in LA, and then we’ll do one in DC, and then we’ll do one in New York, and then we’ll do one in San Francisco. And then we’ll do it in other places in the world. And then we’ll have a network of tunnels that can take you from anywhere in the city to anywhere else in the city at high speed."," Yeah, traffic is just maddening.

"Yeah, but even subways tend to be essentially two-dimensional. You’ll have a subway cross another subway, but they’ve never really tried to make many layers of subways. The cost of tunneling, historically, has been prohibitive. And they’ve also been incredibly slow. The typical cost for a subway, per-mile cost for a subway in the U.S. has been about a billion dollars a mile, so that is not a very scalable solution."," Yeah, but it’s like a subway on steroids."," Yeah, it’s sort of like a subway in a tunnel. You can go 3D on your tunnels and have many levels of tunnels. You can go as many levels as you want, and you can arbitrarily change the number of levels of tunnels. You can change it dynamically based on demand. So if you’ve got a tunnel that’s got, say, 20 levels, and normally that’s more than you need, but then for special events, you can change the number of levels dynamically.",A,A
"You could certainly have a subway system which had many layers of tunnels, but the tunnels are so prohibitively expensive that they don’t do it. But you can go down 100 levels if you want to; you could have 100 layers of tunnels on top of each other. You can go further down than you can go up. So the deepest mines are much deeper than the tallest buildings. But, really, the key is a massive improvement in tunneling technology. That’s the linchpin, that’s fundamentally what it amounts to.
