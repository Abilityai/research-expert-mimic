Thanks for having me., Great to be here.," Hey, thanks for having me.",B,B
"Well, first of all, I think if somebody is doing something that is useful to the rest of society, I think that's a good thing. Like, it doesn't have to change theworld. If you make something that has high value to people... And frankly, even if it's something, if it's like just a little game or some improvement in photo sharing or something, if it has a small amount of good for a large number of people, It hink that's fine. Stuff doesn't need to change the world just to be good. But in terms of things that I think are most like to affect the future of humanity, I think AI is probably the single biggest item in the near-term that's likely to affect humanity. So, it's very important that we have the advent of AI in a good way. It's something that, if you could look into the crystal ball and to the future, you would like that outcome because it is something that could go wrong, as we've talked about many times. And so, we really need to make sure it goes right. So that's AI,working on AI and making sure it's great future. That's the most important thing, It hink, right now, the most pressing item. Then, I would say anything to do with genetics. If you can actually solve genetic diseases, if you can prevent dementia or Alzheimer's or something like that with genetic reprograming, that would be wonderful. So I think genetics might be the sort of second most important item. And then, I think, having a high-bandwidth interface to the brain. We're currently bandwidth-limited. We have a digital tertiary self in the form of out email capabilities, our computers, phones, applications. We're practically superhuman. But we're extremely bandwidth-constrained in that interface between the cortex and that tertiary digital form of yourself. And helping solve that bandwidth constraint would be, I think, very important in the future as well. Yeah."," Well, I think I’d probably still be working on the same things. I mean, I think the things that are most important are the things that are going to affect the future of humanity and the future of life on Earth. So, I think the things that are most important are the things that are going to affect the future of humanity and the future of life on Earth."," Well, I’m not 22 anymore. I’m 51.",A,A
"Well, first of all, I should say that I do not expect to be involved in all these things. So, the five things that I thought about at the time in college, so quite along time ago, 25 years ago, making life multi-planetary, accelerating the transmission to sustainable energy, the Internet broadly speaking, and then genetics, and AI. I didn't expect to be involved in all those things. Actually, at the time in college, I sort of thought helping with electrification of cars was how it would start out. That's actually what I worked on as an intern was advanced ultra-capacitors, to see if there would be a breakthrough relative to batteries for energy storage in cars. And then, when I came out to go to Stanford, that's what I was going to be doing my grad studies on was working on advanced energy storage technologies for electric cars. And I put that on hold to start an Internet company in '95 because there does seem to be a time for particular technologies when they're at a steep point in the inflection curve. And I didn't want to do a PHD atStanford and watch it all happen. I wasn't entirely certain that the technology I'd be working on would succeed. You can get a doctorate on many things that ultimately do not a have practical bearing on the world. And I really was just trying to be useful. That's the optimization. It's like, ""What can I do that would actually be useful?"""," Well, I think I've been very fortunate in that I've been able to start companies and have them succeed. And I think that's a big deal. I think a lot of people have great ideas, but they don't succeed in executing on those ideas. And I think that's a big deal. I think it's important to have a high success rate in starting companies. I think that's a big deal. And I think I've been able to do that. And I think that's a big deal. I think it's important to have a high success rate in starting companies. I think that's a big deal. And I think I've been able to do that. And I think that's a big deal."," I think, like, a lot of people can have a big impact. I just happened to have a big impact. But I think if you work on things that are useful to other people, so if you sort of do engineering that is useful, or if you’re in medicine and you’re helping cure diseases or doing something to improve the productivity of the world or solving a problem that is important for the future of humanity, then you can have a very big impact. And I think most people can have a big impact if they just work on things that are useful to other people. And just keep doing that, just keep doing useful things. And then, the impact will be commensurate with the usefulness of the thing and the scope. Like, if it’s a thing that is useful to a large number of people or to all people, then your scope will be all people. And that’s basically what I did. I just kept doing useful things. And then, the scope just expanded naturally.",B,B
Mostly not.," I think it depends on what you want to do. If you want to do fundamental research, then a PhD is probably a good idea. If you want to do something that's more practical, then a PhD is probably not a good idea."," I think it's not necessary to get a PhD in order to be useful. I would encourage people to read a lot of books, basically try to internalize as much knowledge as possible, and try to be useful. I think that's the best thing that you can do.",B,A
"Some yes, but mostly not."," I think the way to be useful is to try to understand the world as it is, not as you wish it to be, and to try to take actions that are in the service of the truth.", I don’t know. That’s up to other people to decide. I’m just going to try to make it last as long as possible and hand it off to someone who can make it last even longer.,B,A
"Well, I think you make some estimates of, whatever this thing is that you're trying to create, what would be the utility delta compared to the current state of the art times how many people it would affect. So that's why I think having something that makes a big difference but affects sort of small to moderate number of people is great, as is something that makes even a small difference but affects a vast number of people. Like, the area under the curve."," I think you should try to do things that you think are useful, and then if they’re not useful, you should stop doing them.", Try to have a positive impact on the world.,A,A
"Yeah, exactly. I mean, the area under the curve would actually be roughly similar for those two things, so it's actually really about just trying to be useful and matter.", Yeah.," Yeah, because you can have something that saves a million lives, but if it only affects 10 people, it’s not really that big of a deal. But if it affects 10 million people, that’s a big deal.",B,B
"Very crazy. For sure. They were not shy of saying that. But I agreed with them that it was quite crazy. Crazy...if the objective was to achieve the best risk-adjusted return, starting off a company is insane. But that was not my objective. I'd soon come to a conclusion that if something didn't happen to improve rocket technology, we'd be stuck on earth forever. And the big aerospace companies had just had no interest in radical innovation. All they wanted to do was try tomake their old technology slightly better every year. And in fact, sometimes it would actually get worse. Particularly in rockets, it was pretty bad. In '69 we were able to go to the moon with the Saturn 5. And then the space shuttle could onlytake people to low-earth orbit. And then the space shuttle retired. And that trend basically trends to zero. People sometimes think technology just automatically gets better every year but actually it doesn't. It only gets better if smart people work like crazy to make it better. That's how any technology actually gets better. By itself, technology, if people don't work at it, actually will decline. Look at the history of civilizations,many civilizations. Look at, say, ancient Egypt, where they were able to build these incredible pyramids and then they basically forgot how to build pyramids. And even hieroglyphics. They forgot how to read hieroglyphics. Or if you look atRome and how they were able to build these incredible roadways and aqueduct sand indoor plumbing, they forgot how to do all of those things. There are many such examples in history. So I think we should always bear in mind that entropy is not on your side."," Yeah, it was."," 2001

"Well, first of all I'd say I actually think I feel fear quite strongly. So it's not as though I just have the absence of fear. I feel it quite strongly. There are just times when something is important enough that you believe in it enough that you do it in spite of fear."," I think it's important to remember that if you're going to do something that's difficult, you're going to be told it's crazy."," I think I have actually a fairly low fear of danger. I don’t know what the exact word is. But I’m not a risk averse person. And I think that the things that I’ve done, in order to do something… like, say, launching SpaceX or Tesla, or taking over as CEO of PayPal, which was really an extremely difficult situation to take over as CEO of a public company, especially if you’re not from the Valley, which I wasn’t, really no one knew who I was. I was just some Canadian guy. And now let’s see, we’ll go to Mars. I’m not sure if this is normal or not. I don’t know what the normal… I don’t know what the bell curve looks like for, say, executives or something. But if you’re at the far extreme of anything, you’re going to be, you know, to the right or to the left of the bell curve. I’m probably to the left, but quite a bit.
Or another way to think about it is that most people are kind of in the bell curve. The normal distribution. But there’s a few people that are to the left of the bell curve, and a few people that are to the right of the bell curve. And most people are just kind of in the middle. But if you’re in the top one or two percent, you’re to the right of the bell curve. And if you’re in the bottom one or two percent, you’re to the left of the bell curve. I think I’m probably, like I said, a little bit to the left of the bell curve, but more than most people, for sure.",A,A
"It's like, people shouldn't think, well, ""I feel fear about this and therefore I shouldn't do it,"" it's normal to feel fear. Like, you'd have to have something mentally wrong with you if you don't feel fear."," I mean, I think it's important to be able to take risks and to be able to take risks that are important to you. And I think if you're going to take risks, you should take risks that are important to you.", I think the battle for the future of civilization is the battle between physics and psychology. Physics is the law and psychology is the squirm.,A,A
"Yeah. You know, actually something that can be helpful is fatalism, to some degree. If you just accept the probabilities, then that diminishes fear. When starting SpaceX, I thought the odds of success were less than 10% and I just accepted that actually probably I would just lose everything. But that maybe would make some progress. If we could just move the ball forward, even if we died, maybe some other company could pick up the baton and keep moving it forward, so we'd still do some good. Yeah, same with Tesla. I thought the odds ofa car company succeeding were extremely low.", Yeah., Yeah.,B,A
"Well, oddly enough, I actually think they're pretty good.", I think there's a good chance that we will get to Mars in the next 15 to 20 years.," Well, I think there’s a good chance it happens in my lifetime.",B,A
"I hope I'm not in some realm of self-delusion here. But look at it this way: at this point, I'm certain there is a way. I'm certain that success is one of possible outcomes for establishing a self-sustaining Mars colony, a growing Mars colony. I'm certain that is possible. Whereas until maybe a few years ago, I was not sure that success was even one of the possible outcomes. In terms of having some meaningful number of people going to Mars, I think this is potentially something that can be accomplished in about 10 years. Maybe sooner, maybe nine years. Indeed to make sure that SpaceX doesn't die between now and then and that I don't die, or if I do die, that someone takes over who will continue that.", I think you can come back.," Sure. Just fill out this form. And we’ll get it notarized, and you’re good to go.",A,A
"Yeah, exactly. The first launch will be robotic anyway.", I'm not going on the first launch., I will probably go on the second launch.,A,A
"Yeah, the internet latency would be pretty significant. Mars is roughly 12 light minutes from the sun and Earth is 8 light minutes. So, the closest approach to Mass is four light minutes away. The furthest approach is 20. A little more because you can't sort of talk directly through the sun."," Yeah, the latency is a problem."," Yeah, that’s going to be really good.",A,A
"Okay, I mean I do want to emphasize that this is not really something that I advocate or this is not prescriptive. This is simply, hopefully, predictive. Because you will hear some say, well, like this is something that I want to occur instead of this is something I think that probably is the best of the available alternatives. The best of the available alternatives that I can come up with, and maybe someone else can come up with a better approach or better outcome, is that we achieve democratization of AI technology. Meaning that no one company or small set of individuals has control over advanced AI technology. I think that's very dangerous. It could also get stolen by somebody bad, like some evil dictator or country could send their intelligence agency to go steal it and gain control. It just becomes a very unstable situation, I think, if you've got any incredibly powerful AI. You just don't know who's going to control that. So it's not that I think that the risk is that the AI would develop a will of its own right off the bat. I think the concern is that someone may use it in a way that is bad. Or even if they weren't going to use it in a way that's bad but somebody could take it from them and use it in a way that's bad, that, I think, is quite a big danger. So I think we must have democratization of AI technology to make it widely available. And that's the reason that obviously you, me, and the rest of the team created OpenAI was to help spread out AI technology so it doesn't get concentrated in the hands of a few. But then, of course, that needs to be combined with solving the high-bandwidth interface to the cortex.", I think we should take the actions necessary to ensure that AI is a force for good. I think we should take the actions necessary to ensure that AI is a force for good.," Well, I’ve said for a long time, I think AI safety is a really big deal. And we should have some regulatory agency that is overseeing AI safety. But there is not yet currently any such thing, and just generally, any kind of regulatory agency run by the government usually takes years to put in place. So, you know, after the population collapse issue, I think AI safety is probably the second biggest threat to the future of civilization. And yeah, like I said, I’m not quite sure what to do with it.
I mean, I’ve been saying for a while now that, you know, an agency that is overseeing AI safety should really be established. And if no one else does it, we will do it. Because we have AI, and we have a lot of smart people, and we have the data. We have more data than anyone else, and we’ve got a lot of smart people, and we got the hardware. So we can actually run large scale, small scale, any scale AI. And we’ve got a lot of smart people at it. So we could certainly do that. I’d much rather someone else does it.",B,B
"Humans are so slow. Yes, exactly. But we already have a situation in ourb rain where we've got the cortex and the limbic system... The limbic system is kind of a...I mean, that's the primitive brain. That's kind of like your instincts and whatnot. And the cortex is the thinking upper part of the brain. Those two seem to work together quite well. Occasionally, your cortex and limbic system will disagree, but they..."," Yeah, we're so slow."," We’re so slow, and our memory is so terrible.",A,B
"Generally works pretty well, and it's like rare to find someone who...I've notfound someone wishes to either get rid of the cortex or get rid of the limbic system.", It generally works pretty well.," Yeah, it does. I mean, the limbic system is kind of the part that really wants to get things done. That's why, like, you'll have, like, a strong physical urge to, you know, have food or to have sex or to do something about a threat. The cortex is kind of the part that's able to plan and think and understand concepts. So you need both. You need the cortex and the limbic system.",B,B
"Yeah, that's unusual. So I think if we can effectively merge with AI by improving the neural link between your cortex and your digital extension of yourself, which already, like I said, already exists, just has a bandwidth issue. And then effectively you become an AI-human symbiote. And if that then is widespread, with anyone who wants it can have it, then we solve the control problem as well, we don't have to worry about some evil dictator AI because we are the AI collectively. That seems like the best outcome I can think of."," It's like, okay, we're going to keep those."," It's like, these are the tools of human will, and people want to use them.",B,B
I think it's going pretty well. I think we've got a really talented group at OpenAI., I think they're doing great., I don’t know. I think it’s going pretty well so far.,A,B
"Yeah, a really talented team and they're working hard. OpenAI is structured as a 501(c)(3) non-profit. But many non-profits do not have a sense of urgency. It's fine, they don't have to have a sense of urgency, but OpenAI does because I think people really believe in the mission. I think it's important. And it's about minimizing the risk of existential harm in the future. And so I think it's going well. I'm pretty impressed with what people are doing and the talent level. And obviously, we're always looking for great people to join in the mission.", Yeah.," Yeah, seems like it.",B,B
"My time is mostly split between SpaceX and Tesla. And of course, I try to spend a part of every week at OpenAI. So I spend basically half a day at OpenAI most weeks. And then I have some OpenAI stuff that happens during the week.But other than that, it's really SpaceX and Tesla.", I spend a lot of time at the factory. I'm there most days. I'm there every day. I'm there every day., I’m up at 5 am and work until 11 pm. I work seven days a week. I’m either working or spending time with my kids. That’s pretty much it. I’m not much of a TV watcher. It’s work or family.,B,B
"Yes, it's a good question. I think a lot of people think I must spend a lot of time with media or on businessy things. But actually almost all my time, like 80% of it, is spent on engineering and design. Engineering and design, so it's developing next-generation product. That's 80% of it."," Well, I mean, I'm not sure how to describe it. I mean, I guess I'm just trying to make sure that the companies are successful. And I think we're making good progress on that front."," Well, it's a lot of meetings. It's talking to the teams, getting updates, providing feedback, making decisions. There's a lot of engineering that's going on. There's a lot of interesting advanced manufacturing techniques that we're developing. And we're trying to set production records every week at both companies. So it's a lot of that, and then there's a lot of design work. I spend a lot of time on product design.",B,B
"Yeah. I think a lot of people think I'm kind of a business person or something, which is fine. Business is fine. But really it's like at SpaceX, Gwynne Shotwell is Chief Operating Officer. She manages legal, finance, sales, and general business activity. And then my time is almost entirely with the engineering team, working on improving the Falcon 9 and our Dragon spacecraft and developing the Mars Colonial architecture. At Tesla, it's working on the Model3 and, yeah, so I'm in the design studio, take up a half a day a week, dealing with aesthetics and look-and-feel things. And then most of the rest of the week is just going through engineering of the car itself as well as engineering of the factory. Because the biggest epiphany I've had this year is that what really matters is the machine that builds the machine, the factory. And that is at least two orders of magnitude harder than the vehicle itself.", I'm an engineer., I try to be the master of at least one thing.,B,B
"Yeah. Now, this actually has a relatively lower level of automation compared to what the Gigafactory will have and what Model 3 will have.", Yeah.," It’s amazing to see it. It’s something special. You know, it’s magic basically.",A,A
"Actually our speed on the line is incredibly slow. I think we are...in terms of the extra velocity of vehicles on the line, it's probably about, including both X andS, it's maybe five centimeters per second. This is very slow.", I think it's 200 a minute.," Well, we’re making some improvements to it. Currently, it’s about 100 cars per hour, and we think we can get it to 200 cars per hour. The key to a high-performance manufacturing line is accomplishing a high percentage of processes while in motion. If you have to stop the line, then that line speed drops dramatically. So getting the processes that are time-consuming and have to be done in motion, getting those optimized for high-speed manufacturing is really the key.
And then it’s also important to have a wide line. So, think of a factory as being like a highway. You can go very fast on the highway, but you can’t go fast if you’ve got a lot of cars in the lane. So having many lines, having a wide line, is important for high productivity. And then the other thing is to have a factory that’s 24/7. We’re planning to have the Berlin Giga-factory to be a 24/7 operation.",B,A
"I'm confident we can get to at least one meter per second. So, a 20-fold increase.", I think we could probably go to 100 kilometers an hour.," I mean, ideally, you’d want to be on the fast lane, which is, you know, 100 kilometers an hour plus. Ideally, you want to be able to go from one interchange to the next, which is like 100 kilometers, let’s say 120 kilometers an hour. And then you can get on the highway, and you can just go for a very long time. And most of the time, you’re probably not going to be going at the top speed. So, you’d be able to go from, say, 0 to 60 in, let’s say, 1.9 seconds, which is a 0 to 60 of 1.9 is 190 miles an hour.",A,A
"Yeah. At least. I mean, I think quite a...one meter per second, just to put into perspective, is a slow walk or a medium-speed walk. A fast walk could be one and a half meters per second. And then the fastest humans can run over 10 meters per second.", Yes.," 200 kilometers an hour. You can get from Westwood to LAX in six minutes – five, six minutes.",B,B
Elon Musk:What’s Twitter?, I’ve made many mistakes., What?,B,B
"Well, I tweet interesting things pretty much as they come to me, and probably with not much of a filter."," Well, I mean, I think Twitter is a good way to get a sense of what’s going on in the world. I think it’s a good way to get a sense of what’s going on in the world."," Well, I think I said some people use Twitter as a… it’s like a fear machine, and they use it to pump out fear. And I think there’s also, I think some people use it to pump out hate, and I think that’s not good. So I think it’s important for the sort of major social media companies to do everything they can to stop the use of their systems for spreading hate and fear.",A,A
"I find it entertaining. I think, “Oh, other people might find this entertaining.” Sometimes they do.", I think it’s a good way to communicate with people.," I think I said I stopped using it because I felt like it was being used by the media to bully people, including me, and people that are not public figures. And I think that’s not good. I think bullying is not good. So I stopped using it for that reason. And then I said that I would only come back to Twitter if there was an extreme commitment to making it a force for good, and that the prior management had shown that they were not a force for good, and that the new management, the X management, was committed to making it a force for good. And I believe that they have given me a credible answer in that regard. So that’s why I’m back on Twitter.",A,A
Yeah. Mostly at home. I spend a lot less time on Twitter than people probably think. It’s like maybe 10-15 minutes or something., Yeah.," Yeah, at night.",A,A
"Yeah. It’s pretty interesting what my most ... What people are most interested in, like some little tweet about “I love anime.” That was it. But it was lowercase “i”, black heart, “anime,” and people loved that. That was like one of my most popular tweets.", Yeah.," Yeah, they do. They’re like, “Uh oh, he’s mad.”",A,A
Not really. I think it’s mostly just if it’s something that might cause a substantial movement in the stock during trading hours. That’s about it.," I mean, I’m not going to change my Twitter behavior. I’m going to be me."," I mean, I certainly will change my Twitter behavior. I mean, look, the point is that I’m trying to be as accurate as possible.",B,A
"I look at it as a way to learn things, kinda stay in touch with what’s happening. It feels like dipping into the flow of consciousness of society. That’s what it feels like. It’s kinda weird. I guess I sometimes use Twitter to express myself, and that’s a weird thing to do, I suppose."," Yeah, I mean, I think it’s a good way to communicate with people."," Yeah, it’s a digital town square, like I said. It’s where people are… This is like, you know, people knock on your door or something. It’s like, well, a lot of people are going to knock on your door. Okay.",B,B
Some people use their hair to express themselves. I use Twitter.," Yeah. I mean, I think it’s a good way to express yourself. I mean, I think it’s a good way to express yourself. I mean, I think it’s a good way to express yourself. I mean, I think it’s a good way to express yourself."," Yeah. I mean, I find the memes to be very entertaining. I mean, the meme war between the BBC and the BBC dog is epic. That is epic.",B,B
"Well, I have to say, my regard for the press has dropped quite dramatically."," I mean, I think I’ve been pretty clear that I don’t like censorship."," I mean, I certainly see the responses, but I don’t necessarily endorse everything that they do. I mean, I certainly get things wrong. I’m not trying to get things wrong, but I do get things wrong.",B,B
"The amount of untruthful stuff that is written is unbelievable. Takethat Wall Street Journal front-page articleabout, like, “The FBI is closing in.” That is utterly false. That’s absurd. To print such a falsehood on the front page of a major newspaper is outrageous. Like, why are they even journalists? They’re terrible. Terrible people."," Well, I think the press has been very dishonest."," I think, in general, the press is taken for granted. They have a lot of power, and they don’t use it responsibly in general. I think they could have stopped a lot of the hysteria about Covid, for example, which would have saved a lot of lives and saved the economy as well. They contribute to the crime as much as anything, I think.",B,A
"The answer is for the press to be honest and truthful, and research their articles and correct things properly when they are false. Which they don’t do.", I’m not attacking the press. I’m attacking falsehoods.," Look, I’m not exactly a leader of the Boy Scouts, but I do think that we should be concerned about the state of the country and the world. And we should be especially concerned about the rise in hate crimes and violence of all kinds. And we should be especially concerned about it being used by the far left and the far right to promote their agendas. And we should be very, very concerned about that. And we should do whatever we can to minimize violence and hate in the world.",A,A
"Yes, of course I do.", I understand that there are some people who don’t like the press., I think we’re not going to agree on this point.,B,A
I suggest the press take it to heart and do better., I think we’re going to be fine. I think we’re going to be fine.," I think we’re in a dangerous cycle now. I mean, look at the demographics of crime. They’re extremely well documented. If you look at, say, the crime in San Francisco, the crime in New York, the crime in Los Angeles, the crime in Chicago, the crime in Philadelphia, and you look at the demographics of who’s committing the crime, it is extremely well documented.
And the mayors of these cities, the district attorneys of these cities refuse to do anything about it. They won’t enforce the law. And they’re the ones who are actually putting people in prison. The police can’t put anyone in prison. The prosecutors put people in prison. And they refuse to prosecute a lot of crimes. And they’re setting very low bonds for crimes. That’s what’s causing crime.
And then the courts are letting people go. The judges are letting people go. This is a huge problem. And the mayors and the district attorneys refuse to do anything about it. They are the ones causing crime. If you want to stop crime, you should be arresting the mayors and district attorneys that are causing crime. That’s my recommendation.",A,B
No., I think the media is the enemy of the people.," No, I don’t. I obviously disagree with a lot of the things that Donald Trump says. I don’t think he’s done… I don’t believe he’s an enemy of the people. I think there are many people who are enemies of the people, but I’d have to agree with him on that.",B,A
"Yeah. There are good journalists and there are bad ones, and unfortunately the feedback loop for good versus bad is inverted, so the more salacious that an article is, the more salacious the headline is, the more clicks it’s gonna get. Then somebody is not a journalist, they are an ad salesman.", I’m not saying that I like Donald Trump. I’m not saying that. I’m just saying that I think we should take the sort of a principle of the sort of the sort of the sort of the sort of the sort of the sort of the sort of the sort of the sort of the sort of the sort

I mean, I think there’s a little bit of a difference between criticism and hateful content, and I’m certainly not advocating putting stuff that is hateful, meaning it’s just… it should be on the platform, it’s public domain, but it doesn’t mean that I have to click on it. I don’t have to give it a thumbs up or promote it in any way. So there’s a difference, I think, between, say, if there’s some… Let’s say, there’s some web site that is just… has some false information about me, it’s not hateful, it’s just false. Do I want to promote that? No. I don’t want to put a thumb up to that. But it’s not hateful, it’s just wrong.",B,A

How do you think rockets get to orbit?, I think I’ve been pretty good at taking criticism.," Well, I mean, I think people don’t understand the cathode. They think it’s simple. They don’t understand the challenges of achieving high aspect ratio with a cathode. The amount of stress that puts on the tab and the backing is crazy. If you get a tab that’s 100 millimeters long and a mile wide – okay, not a mile, let’s say 100 millimeters, that’s really 100 millimeters – and try and just curl that up onto a flat surface and not have it crack, it’s very difficult.
So, there are a number of ways to address this, but they’re all cost and performance trades. There’s no free lunch. You can’t just make a part that’s super high aspect ratio without making some sacrifices on cost and/or performance. So, there are, I think, some very good choices that we’ve made that other people haven’t made. And then the details…  the devil’s in the details. The details are hard.
But I think we have the best cathode approach of anyone – of any company – in the world. And the details, man, the details are hard. That’s what I was trying to convey. It’s like, there are these obvious choices, but then you have to actually make them work, and that’s the hard part.",B,A

"It sounds like you’re not hearing me. Making a car company successful is monumentally difficult. There have been many attempts to create a car company and they have all failed, even the ones that have had a strong base of customers, thousands of dealers, thousands of service centers, they’ve already spent the capital for the factories, like GM and Chrysler, still went bankrupt in the last recession. Ford and Tesla made it barely through the last recession. There’s a good chance Ford doesn’t make it in the next recession.

"Yes. The success of Tesla is, by far, the biggest forcing function for the other carmakers to get into into electric cars. They’ve said so."," Yeah. I mean, I think we’ve shown that electric cars can be made and that they can be made at a high quality and at an affordable price. And that’s really what was missing. People didn’t think it was possible to make an affordable electric car that was high quality.

Or if they’re not sure they can survive if they’re not selling cars at all. Or if they’re not able to sell enough cars at high enough prices to support their stock price. Because the stock price is based on some arbitrary number that analysts have given it, and that’s based on a bunch of assumptions. But the reality is that if you don’t make cars that people want to buy, at a price that they can afford, or that they think is a good value, then you won’t sell cars. It’s as simple as that.",B,A

"Yes. It sort of blows my mind, all these social justice warriors driving around in diesel cars. It’s outrageous.", Yes.," Yes, exactly. If you can’t beat it, join it. From a long-term existential standpoint, that’s like the purpose of Tesla, is to accelerate the advent of sustainable transport. Because the longer we take to do it, the more extreme the measures we will need to take to sustain civilization. I’m not saying that the future is totally bleak, but the longer we take to transition to sustainable energy, the more extreme the measures we will need to take to ensure civilization continues.
So, Tesla’s goal is to try to accelerate that transition. Just to make it happen sooner. That’s what we’re trying to do. I think we’ve got a good track record of doing that. Because of the work that Tesla has done, I think that other companies will be forced to go faster as well. They may not like being forced to go faster, but they will be forced to go faster by the market.",A,A
"No, I think the electrification of transport, and there’s also an important part of Tesla which is solar and stationary batteries, because you need to generate electricity in a standard, sustainable way with solar and then store it at night when the sun goes down with batteries, and then use that energy from the sun to power cars. Without Tesla, this would still happen. There would still be a transition to sustainable energy, but it would take much longer. History will judge this, obviously, but I would say on the order of 10 years, maybe 20 years."," I mean, I think we should take the actions that are most likely to make the future better.", I think the world is headed towards a dystopian outcome.,A,A

We would go bankrupt immediately if we did not raise this money. And since the banks were not coming back with terms, the only alternative was to do a convertible debt round. I was told by many people, “This is going to cause a massive dilution. You’ll have to fire half your people. You’ll have to cut programs. You’ll have to sell the company.” I was like, “No, the banks are not coming back. What’s your alternative?” “Well, we can force you to sell the company.” I was like, “Who would buy SpaceX in 2021?” I mean, it’s crazy.

I haven’t counted exactly, but I would just sort of sleep for a few hours, work, sleep for a few hours, work, seven days a week. Some of those days must have been 120 hours or something nutty. You’re gonna go a little bonkers if you work 120 hours a week. Now we’re down to 80 or 90. It’s pretty manageable.", I am. I’m actually doing great., I’m not under pressure.,B,B
Yeah. It’s not like for fun or something., Yeah. I don’t use Ambien anymore.," Yeah. I mean, I don’t really use Ambien that much. And I stopped using it for a while, and my sleep was still fine. I don’t know. I just don’t wake up in the middle of the night that much. And if I do, I just have a glass of water and then go back to sleep.",A,A
"No, it’s just like, if you’re super-stressed, you can’t go to sleep. You either have a choice of, like, okay, I’ll have zero sleep and then my brain won’t work tomorrow, or you’re gonna take some kind of sleep medication to fall asleep."," It’s like, I’m trying to get some sleep here."," I was just saying that I don’t really… No, I don’t really party. I don’t drink alcohol, don’t really… No.",A,A
"I think at Tesla we’re doing pretty well right now. Tesla’s not staring death in the face. We’re in, I think, a pretty good position. We don’t want to be complacent, but it’s not ... Up until around September, we were really faced with, like, “We must solve this or we’re gonna die,” constantly. I feel like we’re no longer in the staring-death-in-the-face situation."," Well, I think we’re going to make a lot of cars. I think we’re going to make about 5,000 cars a week."," Well, I think we’re off to a great start. We’ve sold more Model 3s than anyone thought was possible in a short period of time. We’ve got a long way to go. There’s a long way to go. I think we will make a significant number of improvements, especially in the software and the in the battery pack. That’s kind of a three-part answer.",B,B
"Well, you never want to get complacent, so we still need to work hard, but I think we’re over the hump. We’re certainly over the hump on Model 3 production. For us, making 5,000 cars in a week for Model 3 is not a big deal. That’s just normal. Now we’re working on raising to 6,000 and then 7,000 Model 3s a week, while still keeping costs under control. We could probably do 6,000 or more, maybe 6,500 Model 3s a week right now, but it would have to stress people out and do tons of overtime.", Yeah.," No, but it’s not imminent. It’s not like, “Okay, we better hurry and get this done because otherwise, we’re toast.” It’s not that.",B,B
Drive on Navigation?," Yeah, so we’ve got a new navigation system that’s coming out. It’s really great. It’s got a bunch of new features. It’s got real-time traffic, real-time road construction, and it’s got a new map. The map is much better. It’s got a lot more detail. It’s got a lot more information. It’s got a lot more points of interest. It’s got a lot more data. It’s got a lot more data."," Yeah, so we just released the new navigation feature. It’s using our own hardware and software. So far, it’s very good. It’s using a combination of GPS, cellular, and WiFi to determine where you are. And then it’s using visual recognition to know where you are. So, it’s using the cameras in the car to see where you are. So, you can’t trick it by just using a map. That’s very important.
So, it’s very accurate. It knows where you are to within a few meters. And then it can do things like navigate you to a parking spot. It can navigate you to an exact building entrance. If you’re in a large parking lot, it can just navigate you right to the spot.",B,B
"That’s I think one of the first major steps toward full self-driving. You can enter in an address, and from highway on-ramp to highway off-ramp, the car will change lanes. It will go from one highway to the next automatically, and take off-ramp automatically. It’s pretty wild. It’ll overtake a slow car. It’s basically integrating navigation with the Autopilot capability. That’s why we call it Navigate on Autopilot, or Drive on Nav.", It’s pretty good., Okay. Drive on Navigation. Drive on Navigation.,B,B
"Well, the main challenge has been improving the neural net so that we can recognize all types of objects from all eight cameras. There are eight cameras: Three forward, two on each side, and one rear. The big challenge has been solving a wide range of corner cases. So if you have a —"," Well, I think the biggest thing is that the car needs to be able to handle any situation that a person can handle. So, it’s not like the car is going to be perfect. It’s going to make mistakes. But the car needs to be able to handle any situation that a person can handle. And then, it needs to be able to learn from those mistakes and improve."," Well, I guess the biggest challenge is that these are difficult problems. The self-driving car problem is extremely difficult. I sometimes call it the hardest problem in computer science, and that’s saying a lot, because there are many very difficult problems in computer science. But, in my view, creating a self-driving car system that’s safe, full-safety, is the hardest problem in computer science. It’s a very difficult problem.
And then, another difficulty is that the standards for self-driving cars are not yet written. So, it’s not like creating a phone. Like, you can create a phone and test it against a known set of standards. But the standards for full self-driving cars have not been written, and in many cases, the standards that will be written will be retroactive. They’ll be written after someone has been killed or injured in an accident with a self-driving car. And then, the standards will be written such that they pass the public perception test.
So, in my view, the standards for full self-driving cars should be set by the industry, by the regulators, and by public opinion, after someone has been killed or injured. But if you look at the history of automotive regulation, the vast majority of regulations are put in place in response to someone being killed or injured. That’s 99% of regulations. So, my view is that we should view regulations as a form of public opinion. And public opinion can change. So, my view is that we should view regulations as a form of public opinion that can change, and that the industry must adapt to.
But the public has not yet been educated about the fact that there’s a massive difference between level 2 autonomy and level 5 autonomy. And most people don’t even know what level 2 autonomy means. So, we’re really fighting public perception, which is difficult. But I think we’ll win in the end.",B,B
"Yeah, the roads are pretty messy, so you could have, say, skid marks on the road that look like a line. Sometimes tar seams look like a line. Sometimes the lines are just painted wrong, for some reason. One of our biggest challenges, actually, with Drive on Navigation was dealing with forks and gores, where if a lane is splitting, you need to be confident that you’re going either left or right, not down the center. And the car will come to a halt at the first intersection.
Now we’re integrating stop signs, traffic lights, being able to do, say, hard right turns or hairpin bends and that kind of thing.", Yeah.," Yeah, it’s just a bunch of edge cases. You know, if you have a bunch of edge cases, then you need a lot of data and a lot of computing, and then you can solve the edge cases.",B,B
"Yeah, we’re not really thinking about it. We’re assuming that there won’t be —", I think we’ll be able to do it without any regulations.," I think it’s gonna be important to have some regulatory agency that is overseeing the implementation of self-driving cars. I’ve proposed that we just have a very small, minimal regulatory agency that just is just confirming that safety standards are adhered to. I don’t think we should have some sort of a massive regulatory agency that is setting rules and regulations. I think we want to just have a very small, minimal agency that is just confirming that safety standards are adhered to, but that we don’t want to have a massive agency that is setting the rules and regulations because I think that will result in a very slow process. And, you know, the rules and regulations that you have to go through in order to get through a massive regulatory agency will result in a very high cost for the consumer.",A,A
"No. The car needs to drive better than a human driver using the same inputs as a human driver. Eyes are basically just cameras. All creatures on Earth navigate with cameras. A fish eagle can see a fish from far away and take into account the refractive index of the water, dive down and get the fish from far away. There’s no question that image-recognition neural nets and cameras, you can be superhuman at driving with just cameras.", I’m not assuming. I’m saying we’re not thinking about it., I’m not assuming that there will be some regulatory obstacle. I’m saying there will be.,B,B
"Yeah, that’s hopeless. That would, at best, be a specialized solution, and whatever city puts stuff in roads ... You can always make something work for a specific solution, like some special-case solution in some town, you can make that easy, but what you really want is a general solution for self-driving that works worldwide.
I’d love you to sort of assess the competitive landscape.Faraday just lost another founder today, which was the hot company, or the allegedly hot company, I think that’s probably easier to say it that way.Lucid got a billion dollars.How do you assess — Google’s working on stuff, Uber still seems to be hanging in there. I’d love to get your assessment of all of them.
Yeah. I don’t really think that much about competitors. I just say like, you know, how do we make our cars as good as possible? How do we make sure we have like the best engineering and manufacturing talent in the world?
It’s sort of like the old adage with, you know, running ... If you start looking at the other runners, it’s not good, you know. Like, you can lose races because of that.", That’s stupid.," Oh, that would be very helpful.",A,A
"Self-driving, maybe Google, Waymo? I don’t think anyone is close to Tesla in terms of achieving a general solution for working on —", I don’t know. I don’t think about it.," I don’t know. I don’t think any of them are very far along. I mean, the trick is to have a functional full-self driving car, and then refine that and make it progressively better over time. So, I think we have the best chance of having a functional full-self driving car.",B,B
"Yeah. Yeah. You can definitely make things work like in one particular city or something like that by special-casing it, but in order to work, you know, all around the world in all these different countries where there’s, like, different road signs, different traffic behavior, there’s like every weird corner case you can imagine. You really have to have a generalized solution. And best to my knowledge, no one has a good generalized solution except ... and I think no one is likely to achieve a generalized solution to self-driving before Tesla. I could be surprised, but...", Yeah.," Yeah, overall solution. I think the interesting thing is that I’m actually not sure how much Waymo is ahead or behind, but I think they’re ahead on the full self-driving front because they’ve got a big team of engineers that are just focused on autonomy. Whereas at Tesla, we got 150,000 people, 140,000 people, something like that. Only about 10,000 of them are involved in full self-driving. The rest are involved in making the cars, the powertrains, the body, the interiors, and so forth.
So, it’s a much smaller team at Tesla than Waymo, but I think Waymo’s probably ahead, based on number of people, but I’m not sure by how much. But I think the interesting thing is that, I think Tesla’s full self-driving is probably ahead of Waymo’s, but I’m not sure by how much.",B,B
No., None of the car companies., None that I’m aware of.,B,A
"The other car companies ... I don’t wanna sound overconfident, but I would be very surprised if any of the car companies exceeded Tesla in self-driving, in getting to full self-driving.

And I think we’re going to have to do that as soon as possible."," Well, I mean, so far we’ve just been self-funding it. We’ve not taken money from outside investors. And we have a lot of talent and effort, and we’ve been working on it for a long time. But we do expect to at some point need to raise money from outside investors. And we will obviously do that when we feel that it’s… You know, we’ll just raise money when we feel that we need money in order to accelerate progress.",B,B

We don’t need to go private. I think we could execute better if we were private.," I don’t know. I mean, I think we’re going to have to do something to go private. I mean, we’re going to have to do something to not be publicly traded. I don’t know what that is. I think we’re going to have to do something."," I mean, it’s not super private.

"Yeah, you know, not to harp on those short-sellers, because people think I have this obsession with them, but I spent like 1 percent [or] less of time thinking about them —", Yeah.," Yeah, just a lot less noise.",B,B
"Less than 1 percent of my tweets have anything to do with short-sellers. But the issue is that there’s a group of people who are quite smart, very mean, and have a strong financial interest in Tesla’s downfall.
And what that results in is a constant attack on the Tesla brand, on me personally, on the executive team, on our cars. You know, every mistake we make is amplified.
Going private would definitely result in some short-term drama. Let’s say we’re private, and then we went public five years from now. Then the area under the curve of brand damage by short-sellers would be probably less than the short-term difficulty of going private in the first place. That was the approximate calculus.
And then also being public, particularly when everyone at the company is a shareholder, causes a lot of distraction when the share price moves around a lot. It tends to end up being like a mood, to some degree, a mood thermometer. So it’s like the stock goes down, people are sad and feel undercompensated. And then when the stock goes up, people are exuberant, overly exuberant, and you get distracted thinking about what you’re going to buy."," And I’m like, “Why are they so obsessed with me?”"," Yeah, it’s the tweets. I mean, I think I’ve said this before, but I do sort of use Twitter like a release valve. And I think, you know, people may not be aware that you can delete tweets. I delete tweets all the time. So it’s not like… I mean, I say things, and I don’t mean them in some sort of a serious way. It’s just, you know, I’m trying to get some laughs.",B,B

I guess, like, if you get a flying car, you’re still kind of limited by traffic. Like if you have a flying car, you still have to land and take off like a plane. And you’re still limited by the traffic at the airport. So, this is not a solution to traffic. This is only a solution to traffic if you can somehow bypass the traffic at the airport. And most of the airports are really not designed for high throughput.
Like the airports themselves – I’ve joked and said it’s like veal, they’re designed by people who raised veal. It’s like these huge buildings with no windows. And the food is terrible. And the ambiance is depressing. And it’s designed to sort of funnel people through at a slow speed.
So, I think something that… if you could bypass the airport, then a flying car could be useful. But I think the traffic at the airport would still be a problem. So, I’m not sure a flying car would solve traffic. It might help with traffic to the airport. But the traffic at the airport would still be a problem.
I think things that help with vertical takeoff and landing, that’s helpful. If you can go directly from one place to another without having to go to an airport, that would be a big help. And then, the tunnels, I think would help a lot with traffic. So, the tunnels and flying things that avoid airports would help with traffic.",A,B
"A supersonic vertical-takeoff-and-landing electric jet would be interesting to do at some point, I think. But my head would definitely explode if I tried to do that right now.
But I’ve been thinking about that design for nine years. It’s great.", Yeah.," I mean, I think there’s a lot of good things that the government could do. Like, for example, a lot of people don’t have enough money for retirement or healthcare. And that’s pretty terrible. You know, when you get old, and you can’t take care of yourself. Who’s going to take care of you? So, I think, just from a compassion point of view, I mean, that’s like, I don’t want people to just die in the street or something, you know. So, I think, from a compassion point of view, I think the government could do a lot to improve the suffering of the people, you know, the ordinary people, not the wealthy people like me.",B,B

"I think it’s literally the most exciting product lineup of any company in the world. Certainly from a consumer standpoint. I’ll just go through the things that are publicly announced.

We’ve got the next-generation Roadster. Which will be the fastest sports car on every dimension. Fastest acceleration, fastest top speed, best handling. It’s important to have an electric sports car that’s faster than the fastest gasoline sports car. And it helps address that halo effect that gasoline sports cars have. So I think it’s important to do that to show that, you know, electric is the best architecture.
Then we’ve got the pickup truck, which — actually, I’m personally most excited about the pickup truck."," Well, I think we’ll do the Roadster next year."," Well, I can’t say exactly when, but we should have something interesting to say about Roadster towards the end of this year.",B,B

It’s what actually carrying most of the energy to orbit. The upper stage is like the brain and the muscles. The upper stage actually maneuvering the spacecraft, whether it’s putting a satellite in orbit or landing a spacecraft on Mars or something like that.
The boost stage is like the horse in the horse and cart. The horse is still important, but the cart is what really doing the work. So, we showed that we can actually recover the boost stage. In fact, we’ve recovered the boost stage for two different flights now. And on one of those flights, we actually over-recovered the boost stage. We landed it with precision that’s equivalent to landing a 747/737 at the size of a parking lot.",B,B

It’s like, “Oh, okay, this is a good idea.”"," And the Air Corps or whatever it was called at the time was kind of a second-class citizen in the military. And then, when they formed the Air Force, it was like, “Okay, now the Air Force has primacy over the Army, and they can do whatever they want with aircraft.” I think this is a good thing. You know, the Space Force, it’s just a question of time before there’s a Space Force. We might as well make it happen.",B,B
"You know, it’s basically defense in space. And then I think also it could be pretty helpful for maybe expanding our civilization ... You know, expanding things beyond Earth.
I think we could just have a base on the moon, for example. A base on Mars. Be great to expand on the idea of a Space Force. Anyone who has an exploratory spirit, and I think that especially applies to a country like the United States, where you know it’s kind of the distillation of the spirit of human exploration. I think the idea of being out there among the stars and among the planets is very exciting."," Well, I think there’s a lot of things that Space Force could do. I think it’s important to have a military presence in space. I think it’s important to have a civilian presence in space. I think we should have a base on the Moon. I think we should have a base on Mars. I think we should have a base on an asteroid. I think we should have a base on the asteroid belt. I think we should have a base on the asteroid belt."," Well, I mean, we’re really just trying to set the stage for the future. The future we see is one where humanity expands beyond Earth, where we’re a spacefaring civilization and out there among the stars. And we want to make sure that that future is one that is welcoming and one that we want to be around. And if we don’t take these steps to make sure that that future is welcoming and one that we want to be around, then it’s going to be ominous.",B,B
"Yeah, we’re still aiming for 2024."," Yeah, I think 2024."," Yes, 2024.",B,A
"I don’t know if I will go or not. It may be just an unmanned mission, you know. I’m not sure if there’ll be people onboard or not.
But there is a Mars rendezvous opportunity, ’cause you can only do a launch to Mars roughly every two years. So around the 2024 timeframe, there’s a rendezvous opportunity for Mars, which hopefully we can catch. There’s one in 2022 —", I think I’ll go.," I mean, I’ll go at least once. And it’s not super cheap. So, you know, it’s like, it costs a lot of money to go to Mars.",B,B
"Hopefully, there are people on board. But I think there’s a pretty good chance of at least having an unmanned craft go to Mars. I think we will try to do this.", I think it’s probably an unmanned flight to Mars., I think the first flight to Mars will be unmanned.,B,A
"Yeah, I certainly think NASA should continue to exist, NASA does a lot of really useful things, and these go beyond astronaut transport. There are missions to rovers on Mars that are thanks to NASA. There are these planetary probes, there’s the Hubble Telescope. NASA does a tremendous amount of good, and ideally we should actually increase the budget of NASA. I think it’s high time that we went beyond Earth orbit again. I think it’s very exciting and inspiring, and I think it really gets the whole world fired up.
When the first humans stepped foot on the Moon, it was probably the most inspiring thing, maybe in history? We should try to do more of that stuff.", I think they should.," Well, I think right now, NASA is doing a good job. So I would just say, you know, keep doing what you’re doing.",B,B
"Yeah, I think it’s great that Jeff is spending lots of money on space. I think it will encounter some challenges getting to orbit; it’s remarkably difficult getting to orbit. But he has the resources to overcome those difficulties. He’s got some spare change in the couch, I think."," Well, I think it’s great that he’s doing it. I think it’s great that he’s doing it. I think it’s great that he’s doing it."," Well, I don’t know exactly what he’s doing. I know he wants to do it. I don’t know if he’s got the resources to do it. I don’t know if he’s got the talent. I don’t know if he’s got the will. I don’t know what his situation is. But I think I’d like to be… I’d like to not be the only person doing this.
I’d like there to be a lot of people doing it. Because what will happen, I think, probably is that there will be a lot of companies with suborbital capabilities. And then there will be a select few with orbital capabilities. And the price of access to orbit will plummet. I think we’re headed towards a situation where access to orbit is like a ride on a roller coaster. It will be like a thrill ride.",B,B
"No, I don’t generally acquire things.", No., No.,=,=
"I create companies, but I don’t really acquire them. So I wouldn’t ... I have no plans. It does seem to be popular these days.
So let’s finish up the last two things. Boring Company,I was just with Eric Garcetti in Los Angeles—
Oh, great, yeah. Eric’s been a great supporter.", I don’t generally acquire things., I don’t have a watch.,A,A
"Yeah, Eric’s been really supportive of our activity in L.A. I mean, technically, our first tunnels are in Hawthorne. But we do expect to, over time, create a network of tunnels under greater L.A. And I think this is really the key to getting around the city very fast. You’ve got to go 3-D. Our offices are 3-D and dense, but we then have a 2-D road transport network."," Yeah, exactly. So we’re going to do a test tunnel in LA. It’s going to be about a mile long, and we’re going to do it in the space of about a year. And then we’ll do a demonstration vehicle, and then we’ll do sort of a full-on production vehicle. And then we’ll do it in other places.
So the first one will be in LA, and then we’ll do one in DC, and then we’ll do one in New York, and then we’ll do one in San Francisco. And then we’ll do it in other places in the world. And then we’ll have a network of tunnels that can take you from anywhere in the city to anywhere else in the city at high speed."," I mean, I think it’s pretty great that the mayor of LA is pro-tunnel. That’s great. You know, we’re going to do a tunnel under L.A. to alleviate traffic, and we’re also going to do a loop for the hyperloop. So you can just go from one place to another in L.A. without using any energy, just using electric motors.
And then we’re also going to do a connection to the airport. So you can just take a hyperloop to the airport. You don’t need a car, and you don’t need a plane. This is great. So I’m confident that we’ll get something done in L.A.
Somewhere between 2020 and 2030. It’s not a super high priority relative to other things, but it is a priority. And I think we’ll get it done. And then we’ll do it in other cities as well.
So, what’s the question?",A,A
"Yeah, many levels of tunnels, so —"," Yeah, you’ve got to go 3-D.", It’s an underground network of tunnels.,B,B
"Yeah, but even subways tend to be essentially two-dimensional. You’ll have a subway cross another subway, but they’ve never really tried to make many layers of subways. The cost of tunneling, historically, has been prohibitive. And they’ve also been incredibly slow. The typical cost for a subway, per-mile cost for a subway in the U.S. has been about a billion dollars a mile, so that is not a very scalable solution."," Yeah, but it’s like a subway on steroids."," Yeah, it will be faster than the subway, I promise.",A,A
"You could certainly have a subway system which had many layers of tunnels, but the tunnels are so prohibitively expensive that they don’t do it. But you can go down 100 levels if you want to; you could have 100 layers of tunnels on top of each other. You can go further down than you can go up. So the deepest mines are much deeper than the tallest buildings. But, really, the key is a massive improvement in tunneling technology. That’s the linchpin, that’s fundamentally what it amounts to. And as I got sort of digging into tunnels ... Ha-ha, good one."," Yeah, tunnels."," Yeah, it’s got to be tunnels.",B,B
"Yeah, yeah, no, I’ve got a million of ’em."," I mean, I’ve been thinking about tunnels for a long time."," It’s pretty funny. Can’t help it.
(laughs)",B,B
Tunnels are really so underappreciated. They have no place to go but down.," Yeah, I mean, I’m literally digging a hole in the ground."," Yeah, like, literally, the soil is like one inch deep, and then it just goes down far.",B,A
"I am a dad, so —", They’re not even dad jokes., Yeah.,A,A
"No, no, it’s a terrible habit. I laugh at my own jokes, even with the terrible ones. So, what I discovered is that there are massive improvements possible in tunneling technology."," I mean, I’m just saying, I’m not going to be able to do this forever."," I mean, how many Ph.D. papers are actually used by someone ever?",B,A
"Yeah, we’re about to finish the first test tunnel."," Yeah, it’s a test tunnel."," Yeah, it’s just a test tunnel. I wouldn’t recommend putting it in production just yet. There’s a few more revisions that we need to do before it’s suitable for high volume production. The machine itself is quite capable. It’s just a case of refining the design and the controls and the software. I have high confidence that we will solve this. It’s a matter of how fast. I think we should try to try to go as fast as possible.",A,A
"I don’t know, I think it’s probably ... Excluding the equipment, probably cost us $10 million for a mile. It’s one-way, admittedly, but —"," Well, I think it’s about $10 million.", 10 million.,A,A
"We’re planning on having an opening party on Dec. 10th, in six weeks.", I think it’s probably about a year., I think we’ll have an acceptable product for most people towards the end of next year. So we’re really ramping up production. I think we’ll have a good product for most people by the end of 2023.,B,A
