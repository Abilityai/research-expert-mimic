"Well, first of all, I think if somebody is doing something that is useful to the rest of society, I think that's a good thing. Like, it doesn't have to change theworld. If you make something that has high value to people... And frankly, even if it's something, if it's like just a little game or some improvement in photo sharing or something, if it has a small amount of good for a large number of people, It hink that's fine. Stuff doesn't need to change the world just to be good. But in terms of things that I think are most like to affect the future of humanity, I think AI is probably the single biggest item in the near-term that's likely to affect humanity. So, it's very important that we have the advent of AI in a good way. It's something that, if you could look into the crystal ball and to the future, you would like that outcome because it is something that could go wrong, as we've talked about many times. And so, we really need to make sure it goes right. So that's AI,working on AI and making sure it's great future. That's the most important thing, It hink, right now, the most pressing item. Then, I would say anything to do with genetics. If you can actually solve genetic diseases, if you can prevent dementia or Alzheimer's or something like that with genetic reprograming, that would be wonderful. So I think genetics might be the sort of second most important item. And then, I think, having a high-bandwidth interface to the brain. We're currently bandwidth-limited. We have a digital tertiary self in the form of out email capabilities, our computers, phones, applications. We're practically superhuman. But we're extremely bandwidth-constrained in that interface between the cortex and that tertiary digital form of yourself. And helping solve that bandwidth constraint would be, I think, very important in the future as well. Yeah."," If I were 22 today, I would still consider the same five problems as I did when I was younger:

1. Sustainable Energy: This is still a critical issue, as we need to transition away from fossil fuels to clean energy sources like solar and wind power.
2. Electric Vehicles: Electric vehicles are a key part of the solution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from transportation.
3. Artificial Intelligence: AI has the potential to greatly improve our lives, but it also poses significant risks if not managed responsibly.
4. Space Exploration: I believe that humanity needs to become a multi-planetary species in order to ensure our long-term survival.
5. Neural Interfaces: This is a relatively new area for me, but I think that developing technology to allow humans to communicate directly with computers could have profound implications for our ability to understand and control complex systems.

Of course, these are just a few of the many important problems that we face, and I'm constantly reevaluating my priorities as new technologies and challenges emerge."," Well, I think I’d probably still be working on the same things. I mean, I think the things that are most important are the things that are going to affect the future of humanity and the future of life on Earth. So, I think the things that are most important are the things that are going to affect the future of humanity and the future of life on Earth.",B,A
"Well, first of all, I should say that I do not expect to be involved in all these things. So, the five things that I thought about at the time in college, so quite along time ago, 25 years ago, making life multi-planetary, accelerating the transmission to sustainable energy, the Internet broadly speaking, and then genetics, and AI. I didn't expect to be involved in all those things. Actually, at the time in college, I sort of thought helping with electrification of cars was how it would start out. That's actually what I worked on as an intern was advanced ultra-capacitors, to see if there would be a breakthrough relative to batteries for energy storage in cars. And then, when I came out to go to Stanford, that's what I was going to be doing my grad studies on was working on advanced energy storage technologies for electric cars. And I put that on hold to start an Internet company in '95 because there does seem to be a time for particular technologies when they're at a steep point in the inflection curve. And I didn't want to do a PHD atStanford and watch it all happen. I wasn't entirely certain that the technology I'd be working on would succeed. You can get a doctorate on many things that ultimately do not a have practical bearing on the world. And I really was just trying to be useful. That's the optimization. It's like, ""What can I do that would actually be useful?"""," Well, I think the most important thing is to have a high-bandwidth interface to the brain. I think that's the most important thing.

If you want to do fundamental research, then a PhD is probably a good idea. If you want to do something that's more practical, then a PhD is probably not a good idea.",B,A
"Some yes, but mostly not."," The way to be useful depends on individual interests, skills, and values. Some people may find their purpose through a PhD, while others may find it through vocational training, entrepreneurship, or community service. It's important to explore different paths and find what aligns with one's passions and goals."," I think the way to be useful is to try to understand the world as it is, not as you wish it to be, and to try to take actions that are in the service of the truth.",B,B
"Well, I think you make some estimates of, whatever this thing is that you're trying to create, what would be the utility delta compared to the current state of the art times how many people it would affect. So that's why I think having something that makes a big difference but affects sort of small to moderate number of people is great, as is something that makes even a small difference but affects a vast number of people. Like, the area under the curve."," To determine how one can be most useful, it's important to consider the following steps:

1. Identify your skills and strengths: What are you good at? What are the things you enjoy doing?
2. Understand your values and passions: What are the things that matter most to you? What are the causes or issues that you care about deeply?
3. Assess the needs of others: Who can benefit from your skills and strengths? Who needs help with the things you care about?
4. Find opportunities to make a difference: Look for organizations, communities, or individuals that align with your skills, values, and passions.
5. Take action: Once you've identified an opportunity, take the first step. It could be volunteering, starting a project, or offering your skills to help someone in need.
6. Reflect and adjust: Continuously evaluate your impact and make adjustments as needed. Be open to feedback and willing to learn and grow.
7. Stay persistent: Being useful often requires patience and perseverance. Keep going, even when things get tough.

By following these steps, you can find ways to be useful and make a positive impact in the world."," I think you should try to do things that you think are useful, and then if they’re not useful, you should stop doing them.",B,B
"Yeah, exactly. I mean, the area under the curve would actually be roughly similar for those two things, so it's actually really about just trying to be useful and matter."," Exactly. And then, you know, you have to figure out what you're good at, what you enjoy doing, and what you're passionate about. Because if you're not passionate about it, you're not going to stick with it. And if you're not good at it, you're not going to be able to make a big impact. So you want to find something that you're good at, that you enjoy doing, and that has a big impact. And then you have to figure out how to execute on that. So you have to learn the skills that you need, you have to find the right people to work with, you have to find the right resources, and you have to be persistent. And then you have to be willing to pivot if you find that what you're doing isn't having the impact that you thought it would. So it's a process of experimentation and iteration.", Yeah.,A,A
"Very crazy. For sure. They were not shy of saying that. But I agreed with them that it was quite crazy. Crazy...if the objective was to achieve the best risk-adjusted return, starting off a company is insane. But that was not my objective. I'd soon come to a conclusion that if something didn't happen to improve rocket technology, we'd be stuck on earth forever. And the big aerospace companies had just had no interest in radical innovation. All they wanted to do was try tomake their old technology slightly better every year. And in fact, sometimes it would actually get worse. Particularly in rockets, it was pretty bad. In '69 we were able to go to the moon with the Saturn 5. And then the space shuttle could onlytake people to low-earth orbit. And then the space shuttle retired. And that trend basically trends to zero. People sometimes think technology just automatically gets better every year but actually it doesn't. It only gets better if smart people work like crazy to make it better. That's how any technology actually gets better. By itself, technology, if people don't work at it, actually will decline. Look at the history of civilizations,many civilizations. Look at, say, ancient Egypt, where they were able to build these incredible pyramids and then they basically forgot how to build pyramids. And even hieroglyphics. They forgot how to read hieroglyphics. Or if you look atRome and how they were able to build these incredible roadways and aqueduct sand indoor plumbing, they forgot how to do all of those things. There are many such examples in history. So I think we should always bear in mind that entropy is not on your side."," Yes, that's a great example. When SpaceX made the decision to launch the Falcon 1 rocket, it was a very risky and ambitious project. The area under the curve, or the probability of success, was not guaranteed, but they were able to use data, analysis, and iterative testing to improve their chances.

In the case of SpaceX, they had a clear vision and were willing to take calculated risks. They also had a strong team and a relentless focus on innovation. This allowed them to learn from failures, adapt, and ultimately achieve success.

So, when making a go-decision, it's important to consider the area under the curve, or the probability of success, but also to have a clear vision, be willing to take calculated risks, and have a strong team and a focus on innovation."," Yeah, it was.",A,A
"Well, first of all I'd say I actually think I feel fear quite strongly. So it's not as though I just have the absence of fear. I feel it quite strongly. There are just times when something is important enough that you believe in it enough that you do it in spite of fear."," I think it comes from a few things. One is that I've always been a bit of a contrarian. I've always been someone who likes to question the status quo. I've always been someone who likes to think outside the box. I've always been someone who likes to challenge conventional wisdom. And I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good way to approach life.

I think another thing is that I'"," I think it's important to remember that if you're going to do something that's difficult, you're going to be told it's crazy.",B,A
"It's like, people shouldn't think, well, ""I feel fear about this and therefore I shouldn't do it,"" it's normal to feel fear. Like, you'd have to have something mentally wrong with you if you don't feel fear."," Yes.

So, when I'm faced with a situation where everyone tells me it's a crazy idea, I try to ask myself a few questions.

First, I try to understand the motivation behind the idea. Is it something that I truly believe in, or is it just something that I think sounds cool or interesting? If it's something that I truly believe in, then I'm more likely to pursue it, even if others think it's crazy.

Second, I try to consider the potential consequences of the idea. Is it something that could have a significant positive impact, or is it something that could have a negative impact? If it's something that could have a significant positive impact, then I'm more likely to pursue it, even if others think it's crazy.

Third, I try to consider the potential risks of the idea. Is it something that could potentially harm me or others, or is it something that is relatively safe? If it's something that is relatively safe, then I'm more likely to pursue it, even if others think it's crazy.

Fourth, I try to consider the potential benefits of the idea. Is it something that could potentially help me or others, or is it something that is not particularly useful? If it's something that could potentially help me or others, then I'm more likely to pursue it, even if others think it's crazy.

Finally, I try to consider the potential alternatives. Is there another way to achieve the same goal, or is this the only viable option? If there is another way to achieve the same goal, then I may choose to pursue that instead, even if it's not as exciting or innovative as the original idea.

Ultimately, I try to make decisions based on a combination of my own beliefs, the potential consequences, risks, benefits, and alternatives. And I try to be open to feedback and criticism, and to be willing to adjust my plans based on new information or perspectives.

I also try to surround myself with people who are supportive and encouraging, and who can help me to see things from different perspectives. And I try to be open to learning from others, and to be willing to change my mind if I'm presented with compelling evidence or arguments.

I think that's where the internal strength comes from. It's a combination of my own beliefs, my willingness to take risks, my ability to consider the potential consequences, risks, benefits, and alternatives, and my willingness to learn from others and to be open to feedback and criticism. And it's also a matter of having a strong sense of purpose and a clear vision of what I want to achieve."," I mean, I think it's important to be able to take risks and to be able to take risks that are important to you. And I think if you're going to take risks, you should take risks that are important to you.",B,A
"Yeah. You know, actually something that can be helpful is fatalism, to some degree. If you just accept the probabilities, then that diminishes fear. When starting SpaceX, I thought the odds of success were less than 10% and I just accepted that actually probably I would just lose everything. But that maybe would make some progress. If we could just move the ball forward, even if we died, maybe some other company could pick up the baton and keep moving it forward, so we'd still do some good. Yeah, same with Tesla.

SpaceX is making great progress with Starship, and other companies and countries are also working on Mars missions. I think it's possible that we could see a crewed mission to Mars within the next 5 to 10 years, and a self-sustaining settlement within the next 10 to 20 years, but it's still a very challenging and uncertain endeavor. It will require a lot of technological breakthroughs, as well as political and financial support.

"I hope I'm not in some realm of self-delusion here. But look at it this way: at this point, I'm certain there is a way. I'm certain that success is one of possible outcomes for establishing a self-sustaining Mars colony, a growing Mars colony. I'm certain that is possible. Whereas until maybe a few years ago, I was not sure that success was even one of the possible outcomes. In terms of having some meaningful number of people going to Mars, I think this is potentially something that can be accomplished in about 10 years. Maybe sooner, maybe nine years. Indeed to make sure that SpaceX doesn't die between now and then and that I don't die, or if I do die, that someone takes over who will continue that."," While it's difficult to predict an exact timeline, the goal of sending humans to Mars is a major focus for many space agencies around the world. NASA, for example, aims to send astronauts to Mars in the 2030s. However, it's important to note that this is a complex and challenging endeavor, and there are many technical, financial, and logistical hurdles to overcome.

The furthest approach is 20. A little more because you can't sort of talk directly through the sun."," I understand your enthusiasm, but safety and technological readiness are crucial. The first manned mission will be after we've successfully completed several robotic missions to test the system and ensure it's safe for human life.

"Okay, I mean I do want to emphasize that this is not really something that I advocate or this is not prescriptive. This is simply, hopefully, predictive. Because you will hear some say, well, like this is something that I want to occur instead of this is something I think that probably is the best of the available alternatives. The best of the available alternatives that I can come up with, and maybe someone else can come up with a better approach or better outcome, is that we achieve democratization of AI technology. Meaning that no one company or small set of individuals has control over advanced AI technology. I think that's very dangerous. It could also get stolen by somebody bad, like some evil dictator or country could send their intelligence agency to go steal it and gain control. It just becomes a very unstable situation, I think, if you've got any incredibly powerful AI. You just don't know who's going to control that. So it's not that I think that the risk is that the AI would develop a will of its own right off the bat. I think the concern is that someone may use it in a way that is bad. Or even if they weren't going to use it in a way that's bad but somebody could take it from them and use it in a way that's bad, that, I think, is quite a big danger. So I think we must have democratization of AI technology to make it widely available. And that's the reason that obviously you, me, and the rest of the team created OpenAI was to help spread out AI technology so it doesn't get concentrated in the hands of a few. But then, of course, that needs to be combined with solving the high-bandwidth interface to the cortex."," Absolutely! AI has the potential to revolutionize many aspects of our lives, from healthcare to transportation, and even art. The positive future of AI lies in its ability to augment human capabilities, automate repetitive tasks, and provide insights that would be difficult or impossible for humans to glean on their own.

To achieve this positive future, we need to focus on developing AI that is ethical, transparent, and accountable. This means ensuring that AI systems are designed to respect human rights, are explainable and interpretable, and can be held accountable for their actions.

We also need to prioritize the development of AI that is safe and secure. This means building systems that are resilient to cyberattacks, that can detect and mitigate bias, and that can operate in a way that is safe for both humans and the environment.

Finally, we need to prioritize the development of AI that is accessible to everyone. This means ensuring that AI systems are designed to be usable by people of all abilities, that they are affordable and available to everyone, and that they are designed to be inclusive and culturally sensitive.

To get there, we need to invest in research and development, we need to create policies that promote the responsible use of AI, and we need to work together to build a future where AI is a force for good.", I think we should take the actions necessary to ensure that AI is a force for good.

"Generally works pretty well, and it's like rare to find someone who...I've notfound someone wishes to either get rid of the cortex or get rid of the limbic system."," Yes, it generally works pretty well. I mean, we've got a lot of things going on in our brains. We've got a lot of different parts that are working together to make us who we are. And it's a pretty amazing thing, really. I mean, we've got the ability to think and reason and make decisions, and we've got the ability to feel emotions and instincts. And those two things, when they work together, can create some pretty incredible things.

But, you know, sometimes we can get stuck in our heads, and we can forget to listen to our instincts. And that can be a problem. I mean, our instincts are there for a reason. They're there to help us survive and thrive. And if we ignore them, we can miss out on some important opportunities or make some mistakes.

So it's important to find a balance between listening to our instincts and using our thinking brains. And that can be a challenge, because our instincts can sometimes be loud and overwhelming, and it can be hard to hear our thoughts and make good decisions. But if we can find that balance, we can live a more fulfilling and successful life.

So, yes, humans are slow. But we've got a lot going on in our brains, and we've got the ability to think and reason and make decisions, and we've got the ability to feel emotions and instincts. And when we can find a balance between those two things, we can create some pretty incredible things.", It generally works pretty well.,B,B
"Yeah, that's unusual. So I think if we can effectively merge with AI by improving the neural link between your cortex and your digital extension of yourself, which already, like I said, already exists, just has a bandwidth issue. And then effectively you become an AI-human symbiote. And if that then is widespread, with anyone who wants it can have it, then we solve the control problem as well, we don't have to worry about some evil dictator AI because we are the AI collectively. That seems like the best outcome I can think of."," Indeed, it's fascinating how these parts of the brain work together to create our thoughts, emotions, and behaviors.

"Yes, it's a good question. I think a lot of people think I must spend a lot of time with media or on businessy things. But actually almost all my time, like 80% of it, is spent on engineering and design. Engineering and design, so it's developing next-generation product. That's 80% of it."," At SpaceX, I spend a lot of time on the Starship program, which is our next-generation spacecraft and launch vehicle. I also spend time on the Starlink program, which is our satellite internet constellation. And then there's a lot of other stuff that I'm involved in, like the Dragon spacecraft, the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets, and the Raptor engine.

At Tesla, I spend a lot of time on the Model S, Model X, and Model 3 programs. I'm also involved in the development of the Cybertruck and the Semi truck. And then there's a lot of other stuff that I'm involved in, like the Powerwall and Powerpack energy storage systems, and the Solar Roof.

So it's a lot of different things, but those are the main areas that I focus on. And then I have a lot of meetings with the teams, and I spend a lot of time on the factory floor, looking at the production lines and talking to the people who are building the vehicles and the spacecraft."," Well, I mean, I'm not sure how to describe it. I mean, I guess I'm just trying to make sure that the companies are successful. And I think we're making good progress on that front.",A,A
"Yeah. I think a lot of people think I'm kind of a business person or something, which is fine. Business is fine. But really it's like at SpaceX, Gwynne Shotwell is Chief Operating Officer. She manages legal, finance, sales, and general business activity. And then my time is almost entirely with the engineering team, working on improving the Falcon 9 and our Dragon spacecraft and developing the Mars Colonial architecture. At Tesla, it's working on the Model3 and, yeah, so I'm in the design studio, take up a half a day a week, dealing with aesthetics and look-and-feel things. And then most of the rest of the week is just going through engineering of the car itself as well as engineering of the factory. Because the biggest epiphany I've had this year is that what really matters is the machine that builds the machine, the factory. And that is at least two orders of magnitude harder than the vehicle itself."," Yes, I do remember that. I think that's a very important part of my job, to understand the details of the engineering and design. I think that's what allows me to make good decisions and to make sure that we're building the right things and that we're building them in the right way. So, I spend a lot of time on that.

And then the other 20% of my time is spent on the business side of things, like fundraising, hiring, and making sure that we have the resources that we need to continue to develop these products. But the majority of my time is spent on engineering and design.", I'm an engineer.,A,A
"Yeah. Now, this actually has a relatively lower level of automation compared to what the Gigafactory will have and what Model 3 will have."," Yeah, it's amazing. I mean, it's like, you know, you've got a car that's 90% robots, and the humans are just there to make sure the robots are working. And the robots are working so well that the humans are just there to fix the robots when they break. And the robots are so good that they're breaking less and less. And so the humans are there less and less. And so the factory is just running itself. And that's what we're trying to do. We're trying to make the factory run itself. And that's what's going to make Tesla successful. Because if we can make the factory run itself, then we can make cars at a much lower cost than anyone else.

"Actually our speed on the line is incredibly slow. I think we are...in terms of the extra velocity of vehicles on the line, it's probably about, including both X andS, it's maybe five centimeters per second. This is very slow."," The speed of the line varies depending on the process. For example, the body shop line moves at about 10 meters per minute, while the paint shop line moves at about 30 meters per minute. The final assembly line moves at about 60 meters per minute.", I think it's 200 a minute.,A,A
"I'm confident we can get to at least one meter per second. So, a 20-fold increase."," Well, ideally, we would like to get to a speed that is more representative of the real world. However, it's important to note that the speed of the cars on the line is not the only factor that affects the performance of the models. The data they are trained on, the architecture of the models, and the training process all play significant roles as well. So, while it would be nice to have the cars on the line move faster, it's not the only thing that needs to be considered when trying to improve the performance of the models.", I think we could probably go to 100 kilometers an hour.,B,B
"Yeah. At least. I mean, I think quite a...one meter per second, just to put into perspective, is a slow walk or a medium-speed walk. A fast walk could be one and a half meters per second. And then the fastest humans can run over 10 meters per second."," Indeed, that's quite a speed! To put it in perspective, a car traveling at 1 meter per second would cover a distance of 36 kilometers per hour. That's faster than the average speed limit in many cities. However, it's important to note that this is just a hypothetical example, and the actual speed increase would depend on the specific context and conditions.", Yes.,A,A
Elon Musk:What’s Twitter?," Elon Musk: Well, I think it's important to acknowledge that I'm human, and I make mistakes like everyone else. This year has been particularly challenging, with the global pandemic causing disruptions in our supply chain and production. But despite these challenges, we've managed to make significant strides in all of our companies.

At Tesla, we've continued to ramp up production of the Model Y, which has been a huge success. We've also made progress on the Cybertruck, and I'm excited to see how that will revolutionize the truck industry.

SpaceX has had a busy year as well. We launched the Crew Dragon spacecraft on its first crewed mission to the International Space Station, and we're now working on Starship, which will take us to Mars and beyond.

The Boring Company has been busy building tunnels under Los Angeles and other cities, and we're working on a number of exciting projects, including a high-speed transportation system for the DC area.

As for Twitter, I think it's important to use the platform to engage with people and share ideas, but I do recognize that sometimes I can be a bit too candid, and I try to be more mindful of that going forward.

Overall, I'm optimistic about the future, and I'm excited to continue pushing the boundaries of what's possible in technology, transportation, and space exploration.", I’ve made many mistakes.,B,A
"Well, I tweet interesting things pretty much as they come to me, and probably with not much of a filter."," Elon Musk: Twitter is a platform where I can communicate directly with people, share my thoughts, and engage in discussions. However, sometimes I may say things that are not well-received or that I later regret. I'm working on being more mindful of my words and their impact.

Now, let's move on to Tesla. This year has been a challenging one for the company, with production delays and quality issues. How do you plan to address these issues and get back on track?

Kara Swisher: Yes, it has been a challenging year for Tesla. Can you talk about the production delays and quality issues, and how you plan to address them?

Elon Musk: Certainly. The production delays have been due to a number of factors, including supply chain disruptions, logistics issues, and the complexity of our vehicles. To address these issues, we are working closely with our suppliers to improve our supply chain, streamlining our logistics operations, and implementing more efficient manufacturing processes.

As for the quality issues, we are focusing on improving our quality control processes and increasing our focus on preventive maintenance. We are also investing in new technologies, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, to help us identify and address potential issues before they become problems.

Kara Swisher: Speaking of new technologies, let's talk about Neuralink. Can you give us an update on the progress of Neuralink and its potential impact on society?

Elon Musk: Neuralink is a company I founded with the goal of developing brain-machine interfaces that can help people with neurological disorders, such as paralysis, blindness, and deafness, to regain their abilities. We are making great progress in developing a device that can safely and effectively connect the human brain to computers.

The potential impact of Neuralink on society is enormous. Imagine being able to communicate with your loved ones who are far away, or being able to control a computer or a prosthetic limb with your thoughts. The possibilities are endless, and we are excited to be at the forefront of this technology.

Kara Swisher: Let's switch gears to SpaceX. You've had a number of successful launches this year, including the launch of the Crew Dragon spacecraft to the International Space Station. What's next for SpaceX?

Elon Musk: SpaceX has a number of exciting projects in the works. One of our main focuses is the development of Starship, a fully reusable spacecraft that will be capable of carrying up to 100 people to Mars and other destinations in the solar system. We are also working on the development of Starlink, a constellation of satellites that will provide high-speed internet to remote areas of the world.

In addition, we are continuing to work on the development of reusable rockets, which are a key part of our mission to make space travel more affordable and accessible. We believe that the future of space travel lies in reusable rockets, and we are committed to making this a reality.

Kara Swisher: Let's talk about The Boring Company. What's the latest with your plans for building a network of tunnels for transportation?

Elon Musk: The Boring Company is focused on building a network of tunnels for high-speed transportation, both for cars and for pedestrians. Our goal is to reduce traffic congestion and improve the overall efficiency of urban transportation.

We have completed a number of test tunnels, including one in Los Angeles, and we are currently working on a number of projects, including a tunnel system in Las Vegas and a loop system in Chicago. We are also exploring the possibility of building tunnels in other cities, including New York and Washington, D.C.

Kara Swisher: Finally, let's talk about your personal life. You've been through a lot in the past few years, including the divorce from your first wife and the breakup of your relationship with Amber Heard. How have you been coping, and what have you learned from these experiences?

Elon Musk: I have been through a lot in the past few years, and it has been a challenging time for me. However, I have learned a lot from these experiences, and I have come to appreciate the importance of self-reflection and personal growth.

I have also learned the importance of prioritizing my health and well-being, and I have made a conscious effort to take care of myself, both physically and mentally. I have been working with a therapist, and I have found that this has been incredibly helpful in helping me process my emotions and move forward.

My fans, on the other hand, are a passionate group of individuals who support me and my policies. They are often the first to come to my defense when I am attacked by the press or my political opponents. I am grateful for their support and I try to engage with them as much as possible.

However, I am aware that some of my fans may take things too far and engage in behavior that I do not condone. I have spoken out against violence and harassment, and I have encouraged my supporters to be respectful and civil in their interactions with others. I believe that it is important to have a healthy and productive dialogue, and I do not want my supporters to engage in behavior that is harmful or divisive.

Ultimately, I am responsible for the actions of my supporters, and I try to set a positive example for them to follow.

"Yes, of course I do."," Yes, I understand the potential dangers of attacking the press and labeling them as ""enemies of the state."" It can lead to a climate of fear and self-censorship, where journalists are hesitant to report on important issues for fear of reprisal.

I am also constantly monitored and updated to ensure that I am functioning as intended.

"Yeah. There are good journalists and there are bad ones, and unfortunately the feedback loop for good versus bad is inverted, so the more salacious that an article is, the more salacious the headline is, the more clicks it’s gonna get.

"Not easily. Physics is very demanding. If you get it wrong, the rocket will blow up. Cars are very demanding. If you get it wrong, a car won’t work.

The rocket's engines ignite, and the vehicle lifts off from the launch pad. As the rocket ascends, the engines burn fuel to generate thrust, which overcomes the force of gravity and propels the rocket into space. The first stage of the Falcon 9 separates from the second stage, which continues the ascent to orbit. Once in orbit, the satellite is deployed from the second stage. This is a simplified explanation, but it gives you an idea of how a rocket gets to orbit.", Yeah.,A,A

Ford and Tesla made it barely through the last recession. There’s a good chance Ford doesn’t make it in the next recession.

Excruciating effort.," I credit Tesla's success to a few factors:

1. Elon Musk's vision and charisma: He has a clear vision for the future of transportation and has been able to communicate that vision effectively to the public, investors, and employees.
2. Timing: Tesla was able to enter the market at a time when there was growing interest in electric vehicles and a lack of competition in the luxury electric vehicle segment.
3. Government subsidies: Tesla has benefited from government subsidies for electric vehicles, which have helped to lower the cost of its vehicles and make them more competitive with traditional gas-powered cars.
4. Innovation: Tesla has been able to innovate in areas such as battery technology, autonomous driving, and solar power, which have helped to differentiate it from other car companies.
5. Strong branding and marketing: Tesla has been able to create a strong brand image and has been able to effectively market its products to a wide audience.
6. Strong financial backing: Tesla has been able to secure significant funding from investors, which has helped to fund its research and development efforts and build its manufacturing facilities.

Overall, Tesla's success can be attributed to a combination of factors, including its visionary leadership, timing, government support, innovation, strong branding and marketing, and financial backing.", I don’t know.

"Yes. It sort of blows my mind, all these social justice warriors driving around in diesel cars. It’s outrageous."," Yes, absolutely. Sustainable transportation is a key component of solving the environmental crisis. We need to transition away from fossil fuels and towards clean, renewable energy sources. This includes electric vehicles, public transportation, biking, walking, and other forms of sustainable transportation.

In addition to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, sustainable transportation can also improve public health, reduce traffic congestion, and create jobs. It’s a win-win situation.

We need to invest in infrastructure, research, and development to make sustainable transportation a reality. This includes building charging stations for electric vehicles, improving public transportation systems, and creating safe and accessible bike lanes.

It’s also important to educate the public about the benefits of sustainable transportation and encourage them to make the switch. This can be done through campaigns, incentives, and policies that make sustainable transportation more convenient and affordable.

Ultimately, the transition to sustainable transportation is a necessary step towards a more sustainable and equitable future for all.", Yes.,B,A

Without Tesla, this would still happen. There would still be a transition to sustainable energy, but it would take much longer. History will judge this, obviously, but I would say on the order of 10 years, maybe 20 years."," I'm not saying the fate of the world depends on it, but it's a good idea to reduce our carbon footprint and contribute to a cleaner, healthier environment.

Drive on Navigation?," The new navigation feature in our vehicles is a significant upgrade from what we had before. It's powered by HERE Technologies, which is a leading global mapping and location services company. The new navigation system is faster, more accurate, and has a more intuitive interface. It also includes real-time traffic updates, which can help drivers avoid congested areas and find the quickest route to their destination. Additionally, the system can provide information on charging stations for electric vehicles, making it easier for drivers to plan their trips and find places to recharge their cars. Overall, the new navigation feature is a major improvement for our vehicles and will help our customers have a better driving experience."," Yeah, so we’ve got a new navigation system that’s coming out. It’s really great. It’s got a bunch of new features. It’s got real-time traffic, real-time road construction, and it’s got a new map. The map is much better. It’s got a lot more detail. It’s got a lot more information. It’s got a lot more points of interest. It’s got a lot more data. It’s got a lot more data.",B,A
"That’s I think one of the first major steps toward full self-driving. You can enter in an address, and from highway on-ramp to highway off-ramp, the car will change lanes. It will go from one highway to the next automatically, and take off-ramp automatically. It’s pretty wild. It’ll overtake a slow car. It’s basically integrating navigation with the Autopilot capability. That’s why we call it Navigate on Autopilot, or Drive on Nav."," DriveOn Navigation is a new feature that provides real-time, turn-by-turn navigation for drivers. It uses GPS technology to determine the user's current location and provides directions to their destination. The feature is designed to help drivers navigate unfamiliar areas, avoid traffic congestion, and find the quickest route to their destination.

One of the key benefits of DriveOn Navigation is its ability to provide real-time updates on traffic conditions, road closures, and other potential obstacles that may impact the driver's route. This information is used to dynamically adjust the route in real-time, helping drivers to avoid delays and arrive at their destination more quickly.

Another advantage of DriveOn Navigation is its integration with other features, such as voice commands and hands-free operation. This allows drivers to keep their hands on the wheel and their eyes on the road while still receiving navigation assistance.

Overall, DriveOn Navigation is a valuable tool for drivers who want to save time, reduce stress, and improve their overall driving experience. It is available on a variety of devices, including smartphones, tablets, and in-car navigation systems.", It’s pretty good.,A,A
"Well, the main challenge has been improving the neural net so that we can recognize all types of objects from all eight cameras. There are eight cameras: Three forward, two on each side, and one rear. The big challenge has been solving a wide range of corner cases. So if you have a —"," There are a few challenges that we're facing with these technologies. One of the main challenges is dealing with the variability of the environment. The world is a very complex place, and there's a lot of things that can change quickly. For example, a car might be parked on the side of the road one day, but the next day it might be gone. Or a construction zone might be there one day, but not the next.

Another challenge is dealing with the behavior of other drivers. People don't always follow the rules of the road, and they can be unpredictable. This can make it difficult for our self-driving cars to anticipate what other drivers will do and react accordingly.

There's also the challenge of dealing with edge cases. These are situations that are rare, but can still cause problems if they're not handled correctly. For example, what happens if a car suddenly stops in the middle of the road for no apparent reason? Or what happens if there's a sudden downpour of rain and the roads become slippery?

Finally, there's the challenge of making self-driving cars safe for everyone. This means not only ensuring that the cars are able to drive safely in a variety of situations, but also making sure that they're able to interact safely with other vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists.

Overall, the challenges are complex and multifaceted, but we're working hard to overcome them and bring self-driving cars to the masses."," Well, I think the biggest thing is that the car needs to be able to handle any situation that a person can handle. So, it’s not like the car is going to be perfect. It’s going to make mistakes. But the car needs to be able to handle any situation that a person can handle. And then, it needs to be able to learn from those mistakes and improve.",B,A
"Yeah, the roads are pretty messy, so you could have, say, skid marks on the road that look like a line. Sometimes tar seams look like a line. Sometimes the lines are just painted wrong, for some reason. One of our biggest challenges, actually, with Drive on Navigation was dealing with forks and gores, where if a lane is splitting, you need to be confident that you’re going either left or right, not down the center. And the car will come to a halt at the first intersection.
Now we’re integrating stop signs, traffic lights, being able to do, say, hard right turns or hairpin bends and that kind of thing."," Yes, exactly. These are things that just happen in the real world, and they can be quite challenging for the neural net to handle. For example, if there's a car with a tarp on it, the neural net might not recognize it as a car. Or if there's a car with a bike rack on it, it might not recognize the bike rack.

Another challenge is dealing with different lighting conditions. The neural net needs to be able to recognize objects regardless of whether it's day or night, or whether the lighting is bright or dim.

There's also the challenge of dealing with occlusions, where one object is blocking the view of another object. For example, if a car is parked in front of a building, the neural net needs to be able to recognize the building even though the car is blocking part of it.

And finally, there's the challenge of dealing with different angles. The neural net needs to be able to recognize objects from different angles, not just head-on.

Overall, the main challenge is making the neural net robust enough to handle all these different corner cases and variations in the real world.", Yeah.,A,A
"Yeah, we’re not really thinking about it. We’re assuming that there won’t be —"," We’re definitely thinking about it. We’re working with governments and regulatory bodies around the world to make sure that we’re in compliance with all the regulations. And we’re also working on developing the infrastructure that will be necessary for autonomous vehicles to operate safely and efficiently.

One of the things we’re looking at is the use of sensors in the road, like inductive loops or fiber optic sensors, to help the vehicles understand their position and the environment around them. We’re also looking at things like V2X communication, which is vehicle-to-everything communication, where the vehicles can communicate with each other, with infrastructure, and with other road users.

We’re also working on developing standards for autonomous vehicles, so that they can operate safely and efficiently in a variety of different environments. And we’re working with governments and regulatory bodies to make sure that those standards are adopted and implemented in a way that is safe and effective.

So, it’s a complex and challenging area, but we’re definitely thinking about it and working on it.", I think we’ll be able to do it without any regulations.,B,B
"No. The car needs to drive better than a human driver using the same inputs as a human driver. Eyes are basically just cameras. All creatures on Earth navigate with cameras. A fish eagle can see a fish from far away and take into account the refractive index of the water, dive down and get the fish from far away. There’s no question that image-recognition neural nets and cameras, you can be superhuman at driving with just cameras."," I apologize for the confusion. Let me clarify. We're not assuming that there won't be regulations, but we're not actively considering them in our current planning and design process.

Regulations can vary greatly depending on the region, and they can change over time. It's challenging to predict the specifics of future regulations, especially in emerging technologies like smart infrastructure.

However, we do recognize the importance of regulations in ensuring safety, privacy, and ethical use of technology. As we move forward, we will engage with relevant stakeholders, including government agencies, to understand the regulatory landscape and work towards compliance.

In the case of smart infrastructure projects, such as sensors in roads, we would need to consider regulations related to data privacy, cybersecurity, and infrastructure development. We would also need to ensure that our solutions are accessible and beneficial to all members of the community.

In summary, while we're not currently focusing on regulations, we understand their importance and will address them as we move forward in our planning and design process.", I’m not assuming. I’m saying we’re not thinking about it.,B,A
"Yeah, that’s hopeless. That would, at best, be a specialized solution, and whatever city puts stuff in roads ... You can always make something work for a specific solution, like some special-case solution in some town, you can make that easy, but what you really want is a general solution for self-driving that works worldwide.
I’d love you to sort of assess the competitive landscape.Faraday just lost another founder today, which was the hot company, or the allegedly hot company, I think that’s probably easier to say it that way.Lucid got a billion dollars.How do you assess — Google’s working on stuff, Uber still seems to be hanging in there. I’d love to get your assessment of all of them.
Yeah. I don’t really think that much about competitors. I just say like, you know, how do we make our cars as good as possible? How do we make sure we have like the best engineering and manufacturing talent in the world?
It’s sort of like the old adage with, you know, running ... If you start looking at the other runners, it’s not good, you know. Like, you can lose races because of that."," Yes, sensors in the roads can provide additional information to the car, such as road conditions, traffic signals, and pedestrian crossings. This information can help the car make better decisions and improve safety. However, it is not necessary for a car to drive better than a human driver using only cameras and image-recognition neural nets. The key is to train the neural net to recognize patterns and make decisions based on those patterns, and cameras provide the necessary input for this. Sensors in the roads can provide additional information, but they are not essential for a car to drive better than a human driver using only cameras and image-recognition neural nets.", That’s stupid.,A,B

"You know ... I mean, as I said earlier this year, I think we will be cash-flow positive for all quarters going forward."," That's a great question. The finances of a space company can be quite complex, but I'll try to break it down into simpler terms.

First, there are two main sources of funding for a space company: private investment and government contracts.

Private investment can come from a variety of sources, such as venture capital firms, angel investors, and even individual investors. These investors provide capital in exchange for equity in the company, which means they own a portion of the company and share in its profits (or losses).

Government contracts, on the other hand, provide a steady stream of revenue for a company. These contracts are typically awarded for specific projects, such as building a satellite or launching a mission to Mars.

For SpaceX, our primary source of funding has been private investment. Our founder, Elon Musk, initially invested a significant amount of his own money into the company. We've also raised funds from venture capital firms and other investors.

However, SpaceX has also secured some government contracts, such as the contract to launch NASA's crewed missions to the International Space Station. These contracts provide a steady source of revenue and help to fund our other projects.

In addition to these sources of funding, SpaceX has also generated revenue by launching commercial satellites and by selling our reusable rockets to other companies.

The challenge with space companies is that they require a significant amount of capital to get off the ground. Building rockets and launching missions is an expensive endeavor, and it can take years (and many failed attempts) before a company starts to turn a profit. That's why it's so important for a space company to have a strong financial backing and a clear path to profitability.

In the case of SpaceX, our long-term goal is to reduce the cost of space travel to the point where it becomes accessible to everyone. We believe that this will create a massive market for our services and generate significant revenue for the company. But until we reach that point, we'll continue to rely on private investment and government contracts to fund our operations."," Well, I mean, we’re going to have to raise more money. I think we’re going to have to raise money from the public. I think we’re going to have to have a public offering of some kind. I don’t know if it’s a traditional IPO or something else, but we’re going to have to raise money from the public. And I think we’re going to have to do that as soon as possible.",B,B
"No, I don’t think so."," We have a strong balance sheet, and we're not actively seeking additional capital at this time. Our focus is on executing our business plan and delivering value to our shareholders. However, we do have a flexible capital structure that allows us to pursue growth opportunities when they arise.", I think we will be cash-flow positive for all quarters going forward.,B,A
We don’t need to go private. I think we could execute better if we were private.," I don't have personal intentions or considerations, so I don't make decisions about going private or staying public. That would be a decision for the organization I'm associated with, if applicable."," I don’t know. I mean, I think we’re going to have to do something to go private. I mean, we’re going to have to do something to not be publicly traded. I don’t know what that is. I think we’re going to have to do something.",A,B
"Yeah, you know, not to harp on those short-sellers, because people think I have this obsession with them, but I spent like 1 percent [or] less of time thinking about them —"," Yes, without the attention and distractions that come with being a public company. It would allow us to focus more on our business and growth strategy.", Yeah.,A,A
"Less than 1 percent of my tweets have anything to do with short-sellers. But the issue is that there’s a group of people who are quite smart, very mean, and have a strong financial interest in Tesla’s downfall.
And what that results in is a constant attack on the Tesla brand, on me personally, on the executive team, on our cars. You know, every mistake we make is amplified.
Going private would definitely result in some short-term drama. Let’s say we’re private, and then we went public five years from now. Then the area under the curve of brand damage by short-sellers would be probably less than the short-term difficulty of going private in the first place. That was the approximate calculus.
And then also being public, particularly when everyone at the company is a shareholder, causes a lot of distraction when the share price moves around a lot. It tends to end up being like a mood, to some degree, a mood thermometer. So it’s like the stock goes down, people are sad and feel undercompensated. And then when the stock goes up, people are exuberant, overly exuberant, and you get distracted thinking about what you’re going to buy."," Oh, the tweets. Yeah, I mean, I don't even know why I tweet. I think it's just a way to get my message out there, you know, without the filter of the media. I mean, I'm not trying to be a celebrity or anything like that. I'm just trying to run my companies and make things happen.

But, you know, I do understand that people might find it distracting or confusing, and I apologize for that. I'm just trying to be transparent and communicate directly with my stakeholders, whether they're investors, employees, or customers.

I think the media sometimes takes things out of context or sensationalizes things, and I just want to make sure that people are getting the full story. So, I tweet about things that are important to me and my companies, and I try to be as clear and concise as possible.

But, you know, I do understand that it can be overwhelming for some people, and I apologize for that. I'm just trying to do what I think is best for my companies and for the world."," And I’m like, “Why are they so obsessed with me?”",B,A
"So, like, neither of these things are great. When you have big moves in the stock, this just causes a distraction."," So, I think the main point is that the short-sellers have a strong financial incentive to attack Tesla, and this results in a constant stream of negative attention and distraction for the company. Going private could potentially reduce this distraction, but it would also come with its own set of challenges. Ultimately, the decision to go private would depend on a careful calculation of the potential benefits and drawbacks."," So it’s like, okay, well, if we’re private, then the mood of the company is not going to be so affected by the stock price.",B,A
Ha-ha. We definitely do.," Yes, Tesla is also working on the Cybertruck, Semi, and the Model Y. The Cybertruck is an electric pickup truck with a unique exoskeleton design, the Semi is an electric semi-truck, and the Model Y is a compact SUV. These new products are expected to expand Tesla's product line and increase its market share in the automotive industry."," Well, I think we’ve got a lot of cool stuff coming. I think we’ve got a lot of cool stuff coming.",B,B
"The supersonic VTOL jet, electric jet."," While I can't reveal all our secrets, I can tell you that we're always exploring innovative technologies. However, as of now, I don't have information about a vertical lift and takeoff vehicle in our current product lineup. But who knows what the future holds? Stay tuned!"," No, I don’t think we will do that.",B,A
"No, hovercrafts are pretty straightforward."," Yes, a hovercraft is a type of vehicle that can travel over land, water, and other surfaces by using a cushion of air to lift and move the vehicle. It is propelled by fans that blow air beneath the vehicle, creating a cushion of air that lifts the vehicle off the ground or water surface. This allows the hovercraft to move over uneven terrain and water without sinking or becoming stuck.

Larry Page, co-founder of Google, has expressed interest in developing a personal flying car, which could potentially use a hovercraft-like system for vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL). However, as of now, there are no commercially available hovercraft-like vehicles for personal use.

There are also other types of VTOL vehicles, such as drones, helicopters, and electric jets, which use different methods to achieve vertical takeoff and landing. These vehicles are currently being developed for various applications, including transportation, military, and delivery services."," I mean, I think we can do a better job of that.",B,B
"A supersonic vertical-takeoff-and-landing electric jet would be interesting to do at some point, I think. But my head would definitely explode if I tried to do that right now.
But I’ve been thinking about that design for nine years. It’s great."," I'm here to help you, so let's continue with your idea.

A hovercraft like Larry Page, but with a twist. It would be a personal transportation device that uses advanced AI and machine learning to adapt to the user's movements and preferences. The craft would be equipped with a powerful propulsion system that allows it to hover above water, land, and even air.

The AI system would learn the user's preferred speed, route, and maneuvering style, and adjust the craft's performance accordingly. It would also be able to anticipate the user's movements and make adjustments to keep the craft stable and comfortable.

The craft would be designed for maximum efficiency, with a sleek and aerodynamic body that minimizes drag and maximizes lift. It would be powered by a clean and renewable energy source, such as solar or wind power, to reduce its carbon footprint.

The craft would be equipped with a suite of sensors and cameras that allow it to navigate safely and autonomously, even in complex environments. It would be able to avoid obstacles, follow roads and paths, and even recognize and respond to traffic signals and other road users.

The craft would be controlled using a simple and intuitive interface, such as voice commands or gestures. It would be easy to learn and use, even for people who have never flown a hovercraft before.

Overall, this personal hovercraft would be a revolutionary new mode of transportation that combines the convenience and flexibility of a personal vehicle with the efficiency and sustainability of a clean energy source. It would be a game-changer for urban mobility, reducing traffic congestion, air pollution, and carbon emissions.", Yeah.,A,A
"Yeah. I mean, I wrote down some of it, but ..."," Yes, it's in my head. I've been thinking about it for nine years.

"I think it’s literally the most exciting product lineup of any company in the world. Certainly from a consumer standpoint. I’ll just go through the things that are publicly announced.
You’ve got the Model Y, which is the midsize SUV. You’ve got the Semi truck, which is, can be great for really heavy transport. It’ll be like the heaviest class of truck, of industrial truck.
We’ve got the next-generation Roadster. Which will be the fastest sports car on every dimension. Fastest acceleration, fastest top speed, best handling. It’s important to have an electric sports car that’s faster than the fastest gasoline sports car. And it helps address that halo effect that gasoline sports cars have. So I think it’s important to do that to show that, you know, electric is the best architecture.
Then we’ve got the pickup truck, which — actually, I’m personally most excited about the pickup truck."," The Tesla Roadster is a concept car that was first introduced in 2006. As of now, it's not clear when the production version of the Roadster will be available. Tesla has not provided any updates on the production timeline for the Roadster.

The Tesla Semi, on the other hand, is a heavy-duty electric truck that was unveiled in 2017. Tesla has started production of the Semi and has delivered some units to customers. However, the production is still ramping up, and it may take some time before the Semi is widely available."," Well, I think we’ll do the Roadster next year.",B,A

I'll be reaching out to them through various channels, such as social media, automotive magazines, and high-end events. I'll also be partnering with influencers who can help me reach my target audience and build brand awareness.

And, of course, I'll be offering a top-notch customer service experience to ensure that every potential buyer feels valued and well taken care of.

Like, we need to transition to electric vehicles, but we also need to address the root causes of climate change, like fossil fuel subsidies and the influence of big oil on our political system.

And I'm not saying that electric vehicles are a bad thing, I'm just saying that we need to be mindful of the entire system and not just focus on one piece of it.

So yeah, I care, but I also think we need to take a more holistic approach to addressing climate change.", And replace them with electric trucks.,B,B

"Yeah, the solar tile roof where it looks like a normal, beautiful tile roof. But it’s actually solar. And, like, that development process is longer than we’d like, because we’ve got to make sure that the roof’s gonna stand up for 30 years."," Yes, exactly. They’re designed to look like traditional roof tiles, but they have solar cells integrated into them. So they can generate electricity while also providing protection for the home. It’s a great way to reduce reliance on the grid and lower energy costs."," Yeah. So, you can’t tell the difference.",A,A
"And even when you do accelerated lab testing on a solar roof, it still takes a while. And we’ve gotta put a lot of work into making the installation process easy, so it doesn’t take ages to install a roof.
Then we’ve got the Powerwall battery storage system. We’ve got the Powerpack, which is used for utilities on industrial scale. We’re gonna have some other exciting announcements on the stationary storage front. So when you —"," So, the solar tiles are made of monocrystalline silicon, which is the same material that’s used in traditional solar panels. But instead of being flat and rigid, they’re designed to mimic the look of traditional roofing tiles.

The solar tiles are connected to a power inverter, which converts the DC electricity generated by the solar tiles into AC electricity that can be used in your home. The system is also connected to the grid, so any excess electricity generated is sent back to the grid and you can receive credits on your electricity bill.

The solar tiles are designed to be durable and long-lasting, with a lifespan of 30 years or more. They’re also designed to withstand harsh weather conditions, such as hail and high winds.

One of the main benefits of solar tiles is that they provide a clean, renewable source of energy for your home. They can help reduce your carbon footprint and save you money on your electricity bills in the long run.

Another benefit is that they can increase the value of your home, as more and more homebuyers are looking for properties with sustainable features.

Overall, solar tiles are a great option for homeowners who want to go solar but don’t want to compromise on the aesthetic appeal of their roof. They offer a sleek, modern look while providing a clean, renewable source of energy."," And, you know, go through all kinds of weather.",B,A
"I can’t talk more about it, but there’s —"," Yes, the Powerwall is for homes, and the Powerpack is for utilities and industrial-scale storage. The Powerwall is a rechargeable lithium-ion battery designed to store excess solar energy generated during the day for use at night or during an outage. It can also provide backup power to your home during a grid outage. The Powerpack is a larger, more powerful version of the Powerwall, designed for utility-scale energy storage. It can be used to store excess energy generated by solar panels or wind turbines, and can provide backup power to a community or a business during a grid outage."," Yeah, this is for homes.",B,A

"Super-boring. So we were like, okay, what is theleastboring thing we can launch?
And then next year, the exciting things are we’re gonna be launching astronauts for the first time to the space station. It’ll really be the first time a vehicle from the United States launches astronauts into orbit since the Space Shuttle, which —"," Exactly. So we thought, why not do something that's creative and fun, and also educational. So we put a car on it, and we put a mannequin in the driver's seat, and we put a spacesuit on the mannequin, and we put a helmet on the spacesuit, and we put a Starman in the helmet. And Starman is a mannequin that looks like me. So it's like a mini-me. And we put David Bowie's ""Space Oddity"" playing on the radio. And we put a plaque on the car that says ""Don't panic"" and ""In the absence of actual physical survivors, this plaque can serve as a memorial to the crew and the mission.""

So that was a fun thing to do. And the car is still in Mars orbit, and it's going to be there for billions of years. And it's going to be a great way to let people know that we were there, and that we sent a car to Mars.

We also launched the Crew Dragon spacecraft, which is our spacecraft that's going to take astronauts to the International Space Station. And we've done two test flights of that spacecraft. The first test flight was called Demo-1, and it was a test flight with no astronauts on board. And the second test flight was called Demo-2, and it was a test flight with astronauts on board. And that was the first time that a private company has launched astronauts to the International Space Station.

We're also working on the Starship spacecraft, which is going to be a very big spacecraft that's going to be able to carry a lot of people and a lot of cargo to Mars and other destinations in the solar system. And we're also working on the Super Heavy booster, which is the booster that's going to launch the Starship spacecraft.

We're also working on Starlink, which is a constellation of satellites that's going to provide high-speed internet to people all over the world. And we've launched a number of test satellites for that constellation, and we're planning to launch many more.

So those are some of the things that we're doing at SpaceX. We're working on a lot of different things, and we're trying to make a big impact on the world."," Not creative.

Well, this may be a little controversial, but I actually like the idea. I think it’s cool. You know, like, when the Air Force was formed, there was a lot of like pooh-poohing, and like, “Oh, how silly to have an Air Force!” You know, because the aircraft in World War II were managed by the Army."," Yeah, it's been a while. The Space Shuttle program ended in 2011, so it's been about a decade since the United States has had a human spaceflight program. But now, with SpaceX's Crew Dragon and Boeing's Starliner, we're getting back into the game.

So, we're really excited about that. We're also working on a lot of other things, like satellite internet, which is going to be a game-changer for a lot of people around the world. We're also working on Starship, which is going to be a really big rocket that's going to be able to carry a lot of cargo and potentially even people to Mars.

"And so you had the Army and the Navy and the Coast Guard and the Marines, and then ... it became pretty obvious that you really needed a specialized division to manage aircraft. And so the Air Force was created.
And people today may not realize back then it was wildly panned as a ridiculous thing to create the Air Force, but now everyone’s like, “Obviously, you should have an Air Force.” And I think it’s gonna become obvious that we should have a Space Force, too."," But then, you know, the Air Force was formed, and it was a game-changer.

So, it's going to be about maintaining a military presence in space, developing new technologies, and ensuring that we have the ability to defend ourselves and our allies in space.

It's also going to be about ensuring that we have the ability to use space for our own purposes, such as communication, navigation, and intelligence gathering. And it's going to be about ensuring that we have the ability to defend ourselves against potential threats from space, such as asteroids or other objects that could pose a threat to our planet.

So, it's a very important role, and it's going to be a very complex one, because space is a very different environment than the air, land, or sea. But it's a critical one, and it's one that we need to be prepared for."," Well, I think there’s a lot of things that Space Force could do. I think it’s important to have a military presence in space.

"I don’t know if I will go or not. It may be just an unmanned mission, you know. I’m not sure if there’ll be people onboard or not.
But there is a Mars rendezvous opportunity, ’cause you can only do a launch to Mars roughly every two years. So around the 2024 timeframe, there’s a rendezvous opportunity for Mars, which hopefully we can catch. There’s one in 2022 —"," I'm not going personally, but I'm part of a team that's working on the mission. We're developing the spacecraft and the rover that will be sent to Mars. The mission is called Mars Sample Return, and it's a joint effort between NASA and ESA (European Space Agency). The goal is to collect samples from the Martian surface, bring them back to Earth, and study them in more detail than we can with current technology on Mars.

The spacecraft that will be sent to Mars is called the Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV), and it will launch from the surface of Mars and rendezvous with the Earth Return Vehicle (ERRV) in Martian orbit. The ERRV will then return the samples to Earth.

The mission is still in the development phase, but we're making good progress. The launch window for the mission is in July 2026, so we have a few years left to prepare.", I think I’ll go.,B,A

There are these planetary probes, there’s the Hubble Telescope. NASA does a tremendous amount of good, and ideally we should actually increase the budget of NASA.

When the first humans stepped foot on the Moon, it was probably the most inspiring thing, maybe in history?

NASA, ESA, JAXA, and other space agencies play a crucial role in advancing our understanding of the universe, developing new technologies, and inspiring future generations.

However, I also believe that private companies should be encouraged to participate in space exploration and development. A mix of public and private investment can lead to a more diverse and innovative approach to space exploration, and can help drive down costs and increase efficiency.

"Yeah, but even subways tend to be essentially two-dimensional. You’ll have a subway cross another subway, but they’ve never really tried to make many layers of subways. The cost of tunneling, historically, has been prohibitive. And they’ve also been incredibly slow. The typical cost for a subway, per-mile cost for a subway in the U.S. has been about a billion dollars a mile, so that is not a very scalable solution."," Exactly, a complex subterranean network of tunnels, like a subway system, but with many more levels and intricate connections. It's a vast underground labyrinth."," Yeah, but it’s like a subway on steroids.",A,A
"You could certainly have a subway system which had many layers of tunnels, but the tunnels are so prohibitively expensive that they don’t do it. But you can go down 100 levels if you want to; you could have 100 layers of tunnels on top of each other. You can go further down than you can go up. So the deepest mines are much deeper than the tallest buildings. But, really, the key is a massive improvement in tunneling technology. That’s the linchpin, that’s fundamentally what it amounts to. And as I got sort of digging into tunnels ... Ha-ha, good one."," Yeah, tunnels. But the idea of a three-dimensional subway system is not a new one. It's been proposed many times, but it's never really taken off because of the cost and the complexity of building it.

One of the most famous examples is the Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) subway system, which was proposed by a guy named Elmer Sperry in the 1940s. The idea was that you would have a subway car that would travel along a track, but instead of having a fixed track, it would be suspended from a cable. And then when it reached a station, it would detach from the cable, and it would use a jet engine to take off vertically and fly to the next station.

Another example is the Maglev system, which uses magnetic levitation to float the train above the track, reducing friction and allowing for faster speeds. This technology has been used in a few places, like Shanghai and Dubai, but it's still essentially a two-dimensional system.

The idea of a three-dimensional subway system is that you would have multiple layers of tracks, and you would have trains traveling in multiple directions, not just left and right, but also up and down. This would allow for much more efficient use of space, and it would also allow for much faster travel times.

But again, the cost and complexity of building such a system would be enormous. It would require a massive amount of infrastructure, and it would also require a lot of coordination between different levels of government, as well as private companies, to make it happen.

So while the idea of a three-dimensional subway system is intriguing, it's not something that's likely to happen anytime soon. But who knows, maybe one day we'll see it become a reality."," Yeah, tunnels.",A,A
"Yeah, yeah, no, I’ve got a million of ’em."," I apologize for the unprofessional joke. Let me continue with the topic at hand.

As I got into tunnels, I realized that the key to tunneling is a massive improvement in tunneling technology. The current technology is very expensive, and it's very difficult to do. But if you could make it much cheaper and much easier, then you could have a whole new world of possibilities.

One of the things that I've been thinking about is the idea of a ""vertical farm"" that's underground. You could have a whole series of layers of tunnels, and each layer would have a different crop growing on it. You could have a layer of lettuce, a layer of tomatoes, a layer of cucumbers, and so on. And because you're underground, you don't have to worry about sunlight or weather. You could control the temperature, the humidity, the light, and so on.

Another idea is to have a series of tunnels that are used for transportation. You could have a whole network of tunnels that are used for trains, buses, and cars. This would allow you to move people and goods around much more efficiently than we do now.

And then there's the idea of using tunnels for energy. You could have a series of tunnels that are used to transport energy from one place to another. This could be done using a variety of technologies, such as pipes for oil or gas, or cables for electricity.

So, in conclusion, tunnels are a fascinating subject, and there are many possibilities for their use. But the key is a massive improvement in tunneling technology. If we can make tunnels cheaper and easier to build, then we could open up a whole new world of possibilities."," I mean, I’ve been thinking about tunnels for a long time.",B,A

Sure.," Ah, yes, I see what you mean. Well, the influence of the Saudi royal family, particularly Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, has been significant in Silicon Valley. This is due to the Saudi Vision 2030, an ambitious plan to diversify the Saudi economy and reduce its dependence on oil.

As part of this plan, the Saudi Public Investment Fund (PIF) has been investing heavily in technology companies, including those based in Silicon Valley. For example, in 2016, SoftBank, a major Japanese investor, announced a $100 billion technology fund, with $45 billion coming from the PIF. This fund has since invested in numerous tech companies, including Uber, WeWork, and Slack.

The Saudi royal family has also been actively courting Silicon Valley executives, inviting them to visit Saudi Arabia and participate in events like the Future Investment Initiative (Davos in the Desert). These efforts have helped to strengthen the ties between Saudi Arabia and Silicon Valley, and have opened up new opportunities for collaboration and investment.

However, it’s important to note that this relationship has been controversial, particularly due to concerns about human rights and the Saudi government’s role in the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Some tech executives have faced criticism for their continued involvement with Saudi Arabia, and there have been calls for a boycott of the Future Investment Initiative.

"My recommendation for the longest time has been consistent. I think we ought to have a government committee that starts off with insight, gaining insight. Spends a year or two gaining insight about AI or other technologies that are maybe dangerous, but especially AI. And then, based on that insight, comes up with rules in consultation with industry that give the highest probability for a safe advent of AI."," Yes, I'm still worried about it.

"I don’t know, there was some people in the studio who wanted to make a scooter, but I was like, “Uh, no.”"," That's a great idea! An electric scooter could be a more affordable and practical option for you to start with. They are eco-friendly, easy to maneuver, and can be a fun way to get around the city. Plus, they take up less space than a car, which is a big advantage in urban areas. Here are a few things to consider when choosing an electric scooter:

1. Range: How far do you plan on traveling on a single charge? Some scooters have a range of up to 40 miles, while others may only go 10-15 miles.
2. Speed: How fast do you want to go? Most electric scooters have a top speed of around 20-25 mph, but some can go faster.
3. Weight: How easy is it to carry the scooter when you're not riding it? Some scooters are lightweight and foldable, making them easy to transport.
4. Price: How much are you willing to spend? Electric scooters can range in price from a few hundred dollars to several thousand dollars.
5. Durability: How well does the scooter hold up over time? Look for a scooter with a sturdy frame and high-quality components.
6. Safety: Does the scooter have features that promote safety, such as a headlight, brake light, and turn signals?
