Thanks for having me.," Hey, great to be here."," Hey, thanks for having me.",B,B
"Well, first of all, I think if somebody is doing something that is useful to the rest of society, I think that's a good thing. Like, it doesn't have to change theworld. If you make something that has high value to people... And frankly, even if it's something, if it's like just a little game or some improvement in photo sharing or something, if it has a small amount of good for a large number of people, It hink that's fine. Stuff doesn't need to change the world just to be good. But in terms of things that I think are most like to affect the future of humanity, I think AI is probably the single biggest item in the near-term that's likely to affect humanity. So, it's very important that we have the advent of AI in a good way. It's something that, if you could look into the crystal ball and to the future, you would like that outcome because it is something that could go wrong, as we've talked about many times. And so, we really need to make sure it goes right. So that's AI,working on AI and making sure it's great future. That's the most important thing, It hink, right now, the most pressing item. Then, I would say anything to do with genetics. If you can actually solve genetic diseases, if you can prevent dementia or Alzheimer's or something like that with genetic reprograming, that would be wonderful. So I think genetics might be the sort of second most important item. And then, I think, having a high-bandwidth interface to the brain. We're currently bandwidth-limited. We have a digital tertiary self in the form of out email capabilities, our computers, phones, applications. We're practically superhuman. But we're extremely bandwidth-constrained in that interface between the cortex and that tertiary digital form of yourself. And helping solve that bandwidth constraint would be, I think, very important in the future as well. Yeah."," Well, I think the five problems that I thought were most important when I was 22 were probably not the right problems."," Well, I’m not 22 anymore. I’m 51.",B,A
"Well, first of all, I should say that I do not expect to be involved in all these things. So, the five things that I thought about at the time in college, so quite along time ago, 25 years ago, making life multi-planetary, accelerating the transmission to sustainable energy, the Internet broadly speaking, and then genetics, and AI. I didn't expect to be involved in all those things. Actually, at the time in college, I sort of thought helping with electrification of cars was how it would start out. That's actually what I worked on as an intern was advanced ultra-capacitors, to see if there would be a breakthrough relative to batteries for energy storage in cars. And then, when I came out to go to Stanford, that's what I was going to be doing my grad studies on was working on advanced energy storage technologies for electric cars. And I put that on hold to start an Internet company in '95 because there does seem to be a time for particular technologies when they're at a steep point in the inflection curve. And I didn't want to do a PHD atStanford and watch it all happen. I wasn't entirely certain that the technology I'd be working on would succeed. You can get a doctorate on many things that ultimately do not a have practical bearing on the world. And I really was just trying to be useful. That's the optimization. It's like, ""What can I do that would actually be useful?""", I read a lot of books and I thought about the future a lot.," I think, like, a lot of people can have a big impact. I just happened to have a big impact. But I think if you work on things that are useful to other people, so if you sort of do engineering that is useful, or if you’re in medicine and you’re helping cure diseases or doing something to improve the productivity of the world or solving a problem that is important for the future of humanity, then you can have a very big impact. And I think most people can have a big impact if they just work on things that are useful to other people. And just keep doing that, just keep doing useful things. And then, the impact will be commensurate with the usefulness of the thing and the scope. Like, if it’s a thing that is useful to a large number of people or to all people, then your scope will be all people. And that’s basically what I did. I just kept doing useful things. And then, the scope just expanded naturally.",B,B
Mostly not., I think a PhD is a good way to get useful things done.," I think it's not necessary to get a PhD in order to be useful. I would encourage people to read a lot of books, basically try to internalize as much knowledge as possible, and try to be useful. I think that's the best thing that you can do.",B,B
"Some yes, but mostly not.", I think the way to be useful is to do useful things., I don’t know. That’s up to other people to decide. I’m just going to try to make it last as long as possible and hand it off to someone who can make it last even longer.,B,A
"Well, I think you make some estimates of, whatever this thing is that you're trying to create, what would be the utility delta compared to the current state of the art times how many people it would affect. So that's why I think having something that makes a big difference but affects sort of small to moderate number of people is great, as is something that makes even a small difference but affects a vast number of people. Like, the area under the curve.", I think they should try to do things that they love doing and that are useful to other people., Try to have a positive impact on the world.,A,A
"Yeah, exactly. I mean, the area under the curve would actually be roughly similar for those two things, so it's actually really about just trying to be useful and matter."," Yeah, so you can think of it like, say, how many lives would it affect, and how much would it improve those lives. And then you can also think about it in terms of, how many years would it add to people's lives, or how many years could it extend people's lives. And then you can also think about it in terms of, how much happiness would it create, or how much suffering would it alleviate."," Yeah, because you can have something that saves a million lives, but if it only affects 10 people, it’s not really that big of a deal. But if it affects 10 million people, that’s a big deal.",A,A
"Very crazy. For sure. They were not shy of saying that. But I agreed with them that it was quite crazy. Crazy...if the objective was to achieve the best risk-adjusted return, starting off a company is insane. But that was not my objective. I'd soon come to a conclusion that if something didn't happen to improve rocket technology, we'd be stuck on earth forever. And the big aerospace companies had just had no interest in radical innovation. All they wanted to do was try tomake their old technology slightly better every year. And in fact, sometimes it would actually get worse. Particularly in rockets, it was pretty bad. In '69 we were able to go to the moon with the Saturn 5. And then the space shuttle could onlytake people to low-earth orbit. And then the space shuttle retired. And that trend basically trends to zero. People sometimes think technology just automatically gets better every year but actually it doesn't. It only gets better if smart people work like crazy to make it better. That's how any technology actually gets better. By itself, technology, if people don't work at it, actually will decline. Look at the history of civilizations,many civilizations. Look at, say, ancient Egypt, where they were able to build these incredible pyramids and then they basically forgot how to build pyramids. And even hieroglyphics. They forgot how to read hieroglyphics. Or if you look atRome and how they were able to build these incredible roadways and aqueduct sand indoor plumbing, they forgot how to do all of those things. There are many such examples in history. So I think we should always bear in mind that entropy is not on your side.", 2001.," 2001

"Well, first of all I'd say I actually think I feel fear quite strongly. So it's not as though I just have the absence of fear. I feel it quite strongly. There are just times when something is important enough that you believe in it enough that you do it in spite of fear."," I think I'm just not that afraid of death. I think maybe that's quite important. I think a lot of people really fear death, and they don't want to die, and they don't want their loved ones to die. And I think that's a very powerful force. I mean, I've seen many people die, and I've been with people when they died. And I've been with people when they've died, and I've been with people when they've died, and I've been with people when they've died."," I think I have actually a fairly low fear of danger. I don’t know what the exact word is. But I’m not a risk averse person. And I think that the things that I’ve done, in order to do something… like, say, launching SpaceX or Tesla, or taking over as CEO of PayPal, which was really an extremely difficult situation to take over as CEO of a public company, especially if you’re not from the Valley, which I wasn’t, really no one knew who I was. I was just some Canadian guy. And now let’s see, we’ll go to Mars. I’m not sure if this is normal or not. I don’t know what the normal… I don’t know what the bell curve looks like for, say, executives or something. But if you’re at the far extreme of anything, you’re going to be, you know, to the right or to the left of the bell curve. I’m probably to the left, but quite a bit.
Or another way to think about it is that most people are kind of in the bell curve. The normal distribution. But there’s a few people that are to the left of the bell curve, and a few people that are to the right of the bell curve. And most people are just kind of in the middle. But if you’re in the top one or two percent, you’re to the right of the bell curve. And if you’re in the bottom one or two percent, you’re to the left of the bell curve. I think I’m probably, like I said, a little bit to the left of the bell curve, but more than most people, for sure.",B,B
"It's like, people shouldn't think, well, ""I feel fear about this and therefore I shouldn't do it,"" it's normal to feel fear. Like, you'd have to have something mentally wrong with you if you don't feel fear."," I mean, I think it's important to be able to do things that are difficult and that you're not sure you can do. And then you do them. And then you feel good.", I think the battle for the future of civilization is the battle between physics and psychology. Physics is the law and psychology is the squirm.,A,A
"Yeah. You know, actually something that can be helpful is fatalism, to some degree. If you just accept the probabilities, then that diminishes fear. When starting SpaceX, I thought the odds of success were less than 10% and I just accepted that actually probably I would just lose everything. But that maybe would make some progress. If we could just move the ball forward, even if we died, maybe some other company could pick up the baton and keep moving it forward, so we'd still do some good. Yeah, same with Tesla. I thought the odds ofa car company succeeding were extremely low.", Yeah., Yeah.,B,A
"Well, oddly enough, I actually think they're pretty good."," Well, I think we have a good chance of sending an uncrewed vehicle to Mars as early as next year. And then, in 2029, we have a window to send a crew. So I think we have a very good chance of being able to establish a self-sustaining city on Mars in this century."," Well, I think there’s a good chance it happens in my lifetime.",B,B
"I hope I'm not in some realm of self-delusion here. But look at it this way: at this point, I'm certain there is a way. I'm certain that success is one of possible outcomes for establishing a self-sustaining Mars colony, a growing Mars colony. I'm certain that is possible. Whereas until maybe a few years ago, I was not sure that success was even one of the possible outcomes. In terms of having some meaningful number of people going to Mars, I think this is potentially something that can be accomplished in about 10 years. Maybe sooner, maybe nine years. Indeed to make sure that SpaceX doesn't die between now and then and that I don't die, or if I do die, that someone takes over who will continue that."," Yeah, absolutely."," Sure. Just fill out this form. And we’ll get it notarized, and you’re good to go.",A,A
"Yeah, exactly. The first launch will be robotic anyway.", I'll go on the second launch., I will probably go on the second launch.,B,A
"Yeah, the internet latency would be pretty significant. Mars is roughly 12 light minutes from the sun and Earth is 8 light minutes. So, the closest approach to Mass is four light minutes away. The furthest approach is 20. A little more because you can't sort of talk directly through the sun."," Yeah, it’s going to be great."," Yeah, that’s going to be really good.",B,A
"Okay, I mean I do want to emphasize that this is not really something that I advocate or this is not prescriptive. This is simply, hopefully, predictive. Because you will hear some say, well, like this is something that I want to occur instead of this is something I think that probably is the best of the available alternatives. The best of the available alternatives that I can come up with, and maybe someone else can come up with a better approach or better outcome, is that we achieve democratization of AI technology. Meaning that no one company or small set of individuals has control over advanced AI technology. I think that's very dangerous. It could also get stolen by somebody bad, like some evil dictator or country could send their intelligence agency to go steal it and gain control. It just becomes a very unstable situation, I think, if you've got any incredibly powerful AI. You just don't know who's going to control that. So it's not that I think that the risk is that the AI would develop a will of its own right off the bat. I think the concern is that someone may use it in a way that is bad. Or even if they weren't going to use it in a way that's bad but somebody could take it from them and use it in a way that's bad, that, I think, is quite a big danger. So I think we must have democratization of AI technology to make it widely available. And that's the reason that obviously you, me, and the rest of the team created OpenAI was to help spread out AI technology so it doesn't get concentrated in the hands of a few. But then, of course, that needs to be combined with solving the high-bandwidth interface to the cortex."," I think AI is a really big deal. It's probably the biggest risk to the future of civilization. It's also one of the biggest opportunities for the future of civilization. So it's really how it's deployed and what regulations, if any, are put in place. I think it's pretty close to inevitable that there will be some sort of AI safety regulation. It's really just a question of when. I think it's also pretty close to inevitable that there will be some sort of generalized sentience. It's really just a question of when."," Well, I’ve said for a long time, I think AI safety is a really big deal. And we should have some regulatory agency that is overseeing AI safety. But there is not yet currently any such thing, and just generally, any kind of regulatory agency run by the government usually takes years to put in place. So, you know, after the population collapse issue, I think AI safety is probably the second biggest threat to the future of civilization. And yeah, like I said, I’m not quite sure what to do with it.
I mean, I’ve been saying for a while now that, you know, an agency that is overseeing AI safety should really be established. And if no one else does it, we will do it. Because we have AI, and we have a lot of smart people, and we have the data. We have more data than anyone else, and we’ve got a lot of smart people, and we got the hardware. So we can actually run large scale, small scale, any scale AI. And we’ve got a lot of smart people at it. So we could certainly do that. I’d much rather someone else does it.",B,A
"Humans are so slow. Yes, exactly. But we already have a situation in ourb rain where we've got the cortex and the limbic system... The limbic system is kind of a...I mean, that's the primitive brain. That's kind of like your instincts and whatnot. And the cortex is the thinking upper part of the brain. Those two seem to work together quite well. Occasionally, your cortex and limbic system will disagree, but they..."," Yeah, we're so slow."," We’re so slow, and our memory is so terrible.",A,B
"Generally works pretty well, and it's like rare to find someone who...I've notfound someone wishes to either get rid of the cortex or get rid of the limbic system.", Yes.," Yeah, it does. I mean, the limbic system is kind of the part that really wants to get things done. That's why, like, you'll have, like, a strong physical urge to, you know, have food or to have sex or to do something about a threat. The cortex is kind of the part that's able to plan and think and understand concepts. So you need both. You need the cortex and the limbic system.",B,B
"Yeah, that's unusual. So I think if we can effectively merge with AI by improving the neural link between your cortex and your digital extension of yourself, which already, like I said, already exists, just has a bandwidth issue. And then effectively you become an AI-human symbiote. And if that then is widespread, with anyone who wants it can have it, then we solve the control problem as well, we don't have to worry about some evil dictator AI because we are the AI collectively. That seems like the best outcome I can think of."," Yeah, it's like, what are you going to do? Cut it off?"," It's like, these are the tools of human will, and people want to use them.",B,B
I think it's going pretty well. I think we've got a really talented group at OpenAI., I think they're doing great., I don’t know. I think it’s going pretty well so far.,A,B
"Yeah, a really talented team and they're working hard. OpenAI is structured as a 501(c)(3) non-profit. But many non-profits do not have a sense of urgency. It's fine, they don't have to have a sense of urgency, but OpenAI does because I think people really believe in the mission. I think it's important. And it's about minimizing the risk of existential harm in the future. And so I think it's going well. I'm pretty impressed with what people are doing and the talent level. And obviously, we're always looking for great people to join in the mission.", Yeah.," Yeah, seems like it.",B,A
"My time is mostly split between SpaceX and Tesla. And of course, I try to spend a part of every week at OpenAI. So I spend basically half a day at OpenAI most weeks. And then I have some OpenAI stuff that happens during the week.But other than that, it's really SpaceX and Tesla.", I spend a lot of time on Twitter., I’m up at 5 am and work until 11 pm. I work seven days a week. I’m either working or spending time with my kids. That’s pretty much it. I’m not much of a TV watcher. It’s work or family.,B,B
"Yes, it's a good question. I think a lot of people think I must spend a lot of time with media or on businessy things. But actually almost all my time, like 80% of it, is spent on engineering and design. Engineering and design, so it's developing next-generation product. That's 80% of it."," Well, I spend a lot of time on engineering and design. So I'll be in the factory, I'll be in the design studio, I'll be in the manufacturing area, and I'll be in the offices. I'll be with the engineers and the designers and the manufacturing team and the management team and just try to be helpful."," Well, it's a lot of meetings. It's talking to the teams, getting updates, providing feedback, making decisions. There's a lot of engineering that's going on. There's a lot of interesting advanced manufacturing techniques that we're developing. And we're trying to set production records every week at both companies. So it's a lot of that, and then there's a lot of design work. I spend a lot of time on product design.",A,A
"Yeah. I think a lot of people think I'm kind of a business person or something, which is fine. Business is fine. But really it's like at SpaceX, Gwynne Shotwell is Chief Operating Officer. She manages legal, finance, sales, and general business activity. And then my time is almost entirely with the engineering team, working on improving the Falcon 9 and our Dragon spacecraft and developing the Mars Colonial architecture. At Tesla, it's working on the Model3 and, yeah, so I'm in the design studio, take up a half a day a week, dealing with aesthetics and look-and-feel things. And then most of the rest of the week is just going through engineering of the car itself as well as engineering of the factory. Because the biggest epiphany I've had this year is that what really matters is the machine that builds the machine, the factory. And that is at least two orders of magnitude harder than the vehicle itself.", I do have a lot of respect for engineering., I try to be the master of at least one thing.,A,A
"Yeah. Now, this actually has a relatively lower level of automation compared to what the Gigafactory will have and what Model 3 will have."," Yeah, it's pretty crazy."," It’s amazing to see it. It’s something special. You know, it’s magic basically.",A,A
"Actually our speed on the line is incredibly slow. I think we are...in terms of the extra velocity of vehicles on the line, it's probably about, including both X andS, it's maybe five centimeters per second. This is very slow.", I think it's about 100 meters a minute.," Well, we’re making some improvements to it. Currently, it’s about 100 cars per hour, and we think we can get it to 200 cars per hour. The key to a high-performance manufacturing line is accomplishing a high percentage of processes while in motion. If you have to stop the line, then that line speed drops dramatically. So getting the processes that are time-consuming and have to be done in motion, getting those optimized for high-speed manufacturing is really the key.
And then it’s also important to have a wide line. So, think of a factory as being like a highway. You can go very fast on the highway, but you can’t go fast if you’ve got a lot of cars in the lane. So having many lines, having a wide line, is important for high productivity. And then the other thing is to have a factory that’s 24/7. We’re planning to have the Berlin Giga-factory to be a 24/7 operation.",B,A
"I'm confident we can get to at least one meter per second. So, a 20-fold increase."," I mean, ideally, you'd like to have a velocity of at least a meter per second on the line. So you can make a lot of cars if you have a meter per second of velocity. And then you just need to have a long line."," I mean, ideally, you’d want to be on the fast lane, which is, you know, 100 kilometers an hour plus. Ideally, you want to be able to go from one interchange to the next, which is like 100 kilometers, let’s say 120 kilometers an hour. And then you can get on the highway, and you can just go for a very long time. And most of the time, you’re probably not going to be going at the top speed. So, you’d be able to go from, say, 0 to 60 in, let’s say, 1.9 seconds, which is a 0 to 60 of 1.9 is 190 miles an hour.",A,A
"Yeah. At least. I mean, I think quite a...one meter per second, just to put into perspective, is a slow walk or a medium-speed walk. A fast walk could be one and a half meters per second. And then the fastest humans can run over 10 meters per second.", 200 kilometers an hour. That's 0.2 of a second.," 200 kilometers an hour. You can get from Westwood to LAX in six minutes – five, six minutes.",B,B
Elon Musk:What’s Twitter?, I’ve made many mistakes., What?,B,B
"Well, I tweet interesting things pretty much as they come to me, and probably with not much of a filter."," Well, I think Twitter is a very useful tool for getting a message out. And I think it’s also a way to get feedback. I think it’s a way to get a sense of what people think. And I think it’s also a way to get a sense of what the media thinks. So I think it’s a useful tool for getting a sense of what’s going on in the world."," Well, I think I said some people use Twitter as a… it’s like a fear machine, and they use it to pump out fear. And I think there’s also, I think some people use it to pump out hate, and I think that’s not good. So I think it’s important for the sort of major social media companies to do everything they can to stop the use of their systems for spreading hate and fear.",B,A
"I find it entertaining. I think, “Oh, other people might find this entertaining.” Sometimes they do.", I think it’s a good way to get a message out quickly.," I think I said I stopped using it because I felt like it was being used by the media to bully people, including me, and people that are not public figures. And I think that’s not good. I think bullying is not good. So I stopped using it for that reason. And then I said that I would only come back to Twitter if there was an extreme commitment to making it a force for good, and that the prior management had shown that they were not a force for good, and that the new management, the X management, was committed to making it a force for good. And I believe that they have given me a credible answer in that regard. So that’s why I’m back on Twitter.",A,A
Yeah. Mostly at home. I spend a lot less time on Twitter than people probably think. It’s like maybe 10-15 minutes or something., Yeah.," Yeah, at night.",A,A
"Yeah. It’s pretty interesting what my most ... What people are most interested in, like some little tweet about “I love anime.” That was it. But it was lowercase “i”, black heart, “anime,” and people loved that. That was like one of my most popular tweets."," Yeah, they do."," Yeah, they do. They’re like, “Uh oh, he’s mad.”",B,A
Not really. I think it’s mostly just if it’s something that might cause a substantial movement in the stock during trading hours. That’s about it., I think I can still do memes.," I mean, I certainly will change my Twitter behavior. I mean, look, the point is that I’m trying to be as accurate as possible.",B,B
"I look at it as a way to learn things, kinda stay in touch with what’s happening. It feels like dipping into the flow of consciousness of society. That’s what it feels like. It’s kinda weird. I guess I sometimes use Twitter to express myself, and that’s a weird thing to do, I suppose."," It’s a way of… You know, there’s a way to sort of communicate with people."," Yeah, it’s a digital town square, like I said. It’s where people are… This is like, you know, people knock on your door or something. It’s like, well, a lot of people are going to knock on your door. Okay.",B,B
Some people use their hair to express themselves. I use Twitter.," Yeah. I mean, I think it’s a good way to get some sort of feedback. I mean, it’s like throwing a message out there and getting some replies, it’s like, okay, this is what people think about that."," Yeah. I mean, I find the memes to be very entertaining. I mean, the meme war between the BBC and the BBC dog is epic. That is epic.",A,A
"Well, I have to say, my regard for the press has dropped quite dramatically."," I mean, I think I’ve been quite clear that I don’t agree with everything that they say."," I mean, I certainly see the responses, but I don’t necessarily endorse everything that they do. I mean, I certainly get things wrong. I’m not trying to get things wrong, but I do get things wrong.",B,A
"The amount of untruthful stuff that is written is unbelievable. Takethat Wall Street Journal front-page articleabout, like, “The FBI is closing in.” That is utterly false. That’s absurd. To print such a falsehood on the front page of a major newspaper is outrageous. Like, why are they even journalists? They’re terrible. Terrible people.", I think they’re generally not very good at their job.," I think, in general, the press is taken for granted. They have a lot of power, and they don’t use it responsibly in general. I think they could have stopped a lot of the hysteria about Covid, for example, which would have saved a lot of lives and saved the economy as well. They contribute to the crime as much as anything, I think.",B,A
"The answer is for the press to be honest and truthful, and research their articles and correct things properly when they are false. Which they don’t do.", I’m not attacking the press. I’m simply pointing out that they are wrong.," Look, I’m not exactly a leader of the Boy Scouts, but I do think that we should be concerned about the state of the country and the world. And we should be especially concerned about the rise in hate crimes and violence of all kinds. And we should be especially concerned about it being used by the far left and the far right to promote their agendas. And we should be very, very concerned about that. And we should do whatever we can to minimize violence and hate in the world.",A,A
"Yes, of course I do.", I understand that you’re trying to say that I should be censored., I think we’re not going to agree on this point.,B,A
I suggest the press take it to heart and do better., I think we should take the actions that are most likely to make the future better and less likely to make the future worse. And I think we should take action to ensure that the future is good and that we’re able to understand what the future is going to be. And I think we should take action to ensure that we’re able to understand what the future is going to be. And I think we should take action to ensure that the future is good.," I think we’re in a dangerous cycle now. I mean, look at the demographics of crime. They’re extremely well documented. If you look at, say, the crime in San Francisco, the crime in New York, the crime in Los Angeles, the crime in Chicago, the crime in Philadelphia, and you look at the demographics of who’s committing the crime, it is extremely well documented.
And the mayors of these cities, the district attorneys of these cities refuse to do anything about it. They won’t enforce the law. And they’re the ones who are actually putting people in prison. The police can’t put anyone in prison. The prosecutors put people in prison. And they refuse to prosecute a lot of crimes. And they’re setting very low bonds for crimes. That’s what’s causing crime.
And then the courts are letting people go. The judges are letting people go. This is a huge problem. And the mayors and the district attorneys refuse to do anything about it. They are the ones causing crime. If you want to stop crime, you should be arresting the mayors and district attorneys that are causing crime. That’s my recommendation.",A,B
No.," No, I don’t think he’s an enemy of the people."," No, I don’t. I obviously disagree with a lot of the things that Donald Trump says. I don’t think he’s done… I don’t believe he’s an enemy of the people. I think there are many people who are enemies of the people, but I’d have to agree with him on that.",A,A
"Yeah. There are good journalists and there are bad ones, and unfortunately the feedback loop for good versus bad is inverted, so the more salacious that an article is, the more salacious the headline is, the more clicks it’s gonna get.

I don’t have to give it a thumbs up or promote it in any way. So there’s a difference, I think, between, say, if there’s some… Let’s say, there’s some web site that is just… has some false information about me, it’s not hateful, it’s just false. Do I want to promote that? No. I don’t want to put a thumb up to that. But it’s not hateful, it’s just wrong.",B,A

They think it’s simple. They don’t understand the challenges of achieving high aspect ratio with a cathode. The amount of stress that puts on the tab and the backing is crazy. If you get a tab that’s 100 millimeters long and a mile wide – okay, not a mile, let’s say 100 millimeters, that’s really 100 millimeters – and try and just curl that up onto a flat surface and not have it crack, it’s very difficult.
So, there are a number of ways to address this, but they’re all cost and performance trades. There’s no free lunch. You can’t just make a part that’s super high aspect ratio without making some sacrifices on cost and/or performance. So, there are, I think, some very good choices that we’ve made that other people haven’t made. And then the details…  the devil’s in the details. The details are hard.
But I think we have the best cathode approach of anyone – of any company – in the world. And the details, man, the details are hard. That’s what I was trying to convey. It’s like, there are these obvious choices, but then you have to actually make them work, and that’s the hard part.",B,B

From a long-term existential standpoint, that’s like the purpose of Tesla, is to accelerate the advent of sustainable transport. Because the longer we take to do it, the more extreme the measures we will need to take to sustain civilization. I’m not saying that the future is totally bleak, but the longer we take to transition to sustainable energy, the more extreme the measures we will need to take to ensure civilization continues.
So, Tesla’s goal is to try to accelerate that transition. Just to make it happen sooner. That’s what we’re trying to do. I think we’ve got a good track record of doing that.

Without Tesla, this would still happen. There would still be a transition to sustainable energy, but it would take much longer.

I mean, the company has been on a constant growth path, and then suddenly, we had a massive slowdown in sales. I mean, we’re down from selling 1,700 cars a day to 500 cars a day, which is a big, big difference. It’s been extremely difficult. We had to let go of a lot of people.

It was ... like, we had the legal team delivering cars in Q3. Todd [Maron] is great. There was a lot of people ... Everyone had to basically go hardcore to solve the ramp."," I mean, I think it’s just that the growth rate of the company was so rapid that it just exceeded our ability to expand the facilities.

And we’ve got a new cell plant that’s being built right now that will be the largest cell plant in the world. It will be twice the size of the largest cell plant in the world. And we’re still going to need more."," I mean, I thought about it for a long time. I thought maybe there’s some other way to do it. But I just couldn’t think of anything. And, I mean, I really was put under a lot of pressure. This was really a last resort. I was told SpaceX would fail if we did not raise this money. I was told NASA would shut down SpaceX. They would terminate the contract. We would go bankrupt immediately if we did not raise this money. And since the banks were not coming back with terms, the only alternative was to do a convertible debt round. I was told by many people, “This is going to cause a massive dilution. You’ll have to fire half your people. You’ll have to cut programs. You’ll have to sell the company.” I was like, “No, the banks are not coming back. What’s your alternative?” “Well, we can force you to sell the company.” I was like, “Who would buy SpaceX in 2021?” I mean, it’s crazy.

In fact, my brother said, “Look, if you do a self-inflicted wound, can you at least not twist the knife afterwards?” You stabbed yourself in the leg. You don’t really need to twist it in your leg. Why do that?"," I think I’ve made some mistakes in the past, but I think the only way to really accelerate the future is to take bold actions. And I think the reason that Tesla has been successful is because we’ve taken bold actions. And I think the reason that the Model 3 ramp went so well is because we took bold actions. And I think the reason that the Model Y program is going so well is because we took bold actions. And I think the reason that the Shanghai factory was built in record time and with such high quality is because we took bold actions. And I think the reason that the Berlin factory is going to be built in record time is because we’re taking bold actions.

So I think we’re on track to achieve our goal of making 5,000 Model 3s per week this year."," Well, I think we’re off to a great start. We’ve sold more Model 3s than anyone thought was possible in a short period of time. We’ve got a long way to go. There’s a long way to go.

"Well, you never want to get complacent, so we still need to work hard, but I think we’re over the hump. We’re certainly over the hump on Model 3 production. For us, making 5,000 cars in a week for Model 3 is not a big deal. That’s just normal. Now we’re working on raising to 6,000 and then 7,000 Model 3s a week, while still keeping costs under control. We could probably do 6,000 or more, maybe 6,500 Model 3s a week right now, but it would have to stress people out and do tons of overtime."," Yeah, death’s taken a seat in the back row."," No, but it’s not imminent.

Drive on Navigation?," Oh, yeah. So, we’re rolling out navigation to the whole fleet. It’s been in beta for a while. I think it’s pretty good. It’s getting better every day. We’re rolling out lane guidance and speed limits and traffic lights and stop signs and all that kind of thing. And then we’re going to roll out the full self-driving computer and sensors and the car will just drive itself."," Yeah, so we just released the new navigation feature. It’s using our own hardware and software. So far, it’s very good. It’s using a combination of GPS, cellular, and WiFi to determine where you are. And then it’s using visual recognition to know where you are. So, it’s using the cameras in the car to see where you are. So, you can’t trick it by just using a map. That’s very important.
So, it’s very accurate. It knows where you are to within a few meters. And then it can do things like navigate you to a parking spot. It can navigate you to an exact building entrance. If you’re in a large parking lot, it can just navigate you right to the spot.",B,A
"That’s I think one of the first major steps toward full self-driving. You can enter in an address, and from highway on-ramp to highway off-ramp, the car will change lanes. It will go from one highway to the next automatically, and take off-ramp automatically. It’s pretty wild. It’ll overtake a slow car. It’s basically integrating navigation with the Autopilot capability. That’s why we call it Navigate on Autopilot, or Drive on Nav."," So, you can just drive down the highway, and it’ll just keep you in the lane, and if you get into the lane of another highway, it’ll just transition smoothly from one highway to another. And then, if you want to take an exit, you just use the turn signal, and then it’ll slow down, and then take the exit, and then accelerate back up to speed.", Okay. Drive on Navigation. Drive on Navigation.,A,A
"Well, the main challenge has been improving the neural net so that we can recognize all types of objects from all eight cameras. There are eight cameras: Three forward, two on each side, and one rear. The big challenge has been solving a wide range of corner cases. So if you have a —"," Well, I think the biggest thing is that people are still dying in cars. And that’s not good. So, we really need to get autonomy right. And we need to get it out there as fast as possible. The thing that’s going to really get people to adopt self-driving is that it’s much safer than a person. By a lot. By a factor of maybe 10 or more. So, people are going to say, “Okay, I’m going to let the computer do the driving because it’s much safer.” That’s the thing that’s going to really make it go viral, so to speak.
And then, the other thing is that it needs to be affordable. It needs to be available to people who can’t afford a new car. So, it’s got to be available on a subscription basis or something like that. And it’s got to be really hands-off. You just turn it on, and it works. You don’t have to think about it."," Well, I guess the biggest challenge is that these are difficult problems. The self-driving car problem is extremely difficult. I sometimes call it the hardest problem in computer science, and that’s saying a lot, because there are many very difficult problems in computer science. But, in my view, creating a self-driving car system that’s safe, full-safety, is the hardest problem in computer science. It’s a very difficult problem.
And then, another difficulty is that the standards for self-driving cars are not yet written. So, it’s not like creating a phone. Like, you can create a phone and test it against a known set of standards. But the standards for full self-driving cars have not been written, and in many cases, the standards that will be written will be retroactive. They’ll be written after someone has been killed or injured in an accident with a self-driving car. And then, the standards will be written such that they pass the public perception test.
So, in my view, the standards for full self-driving cars should be set by the industry, by the regulators, and by public opinion, after someone has been killed or injured. But if you look at the history of automotive regulation, the vast majority of regulations are put in place in response to someone being killed or injured. That’s 99% of regulations. So, my view is that we should view regulations as a form of public opinion. And public opinion can change. So, my view is that we should view regulations as a form of public opinion that can change, and that the industry must adapt to.
But the public has not yet been educated about the fact that there’s a massive difference between level 2 autonomy and level 5 autonomy. And most people don’t even know what level 2 autonomy means. So, we’re really fighting public perception, which is difficult. But I think we’ll win in the end.",B,B
"Yeah, the roads are pretty messy, so you could have, say, skid marks on the road that look like a line. Sometimes tar seams look like a line. Sometimes the lines are just painted wrong, for some reason. One of our biggest challenges, actually, with Drive on Navigation was dealing with forks and gores, where if a lane is splitting, you need to be confident that you’re going either left or right, not down the center. And the car will come to a halt at the first intersection.
Now we’re integrating stop signs, traffic lights, being able to do, say, hard right turns or hairpin bends and that kind of thing."," Yeah, so you have a neural net that’s trying to recognize objects, and it’s trying to figure out what is the object, and what is the shape of the object, and what is the orientation of the object. And then, once it has a good understanding of the object, then it can figure out what actions to take in order to navigate around that object."," Yeah, it’s just a bunch of edge cases.

I’ve proposed that we just have a very small, minimal regulatory agency that just is just confirming that safety standards are adhered to. I don’t think we should have some sort of a massive regulatory agency that is setting rules and regulations. I think we want to just have a very small, minimal agency that is just confirming that safety standards are adhered to, but that we don’t want to have a massive agency that is setting the rules and regulations because I think that will result in a very slow process.

You can definitely make things work like in one particular city or something like that by special-casing it, but in order to work, you know, all around the world in all these different countries where there’s, like, different road signs, different traffic behavior, there’s like every weird corner case you can imagine. You really have to have a generalized solution. And best to my knowledge, no one has a good generalized solution except ... and I think no one is likely to achieve a generalized solution to self-driving before Tesla. I could be surprised, but...", Yeah.," Yeah, overall solution. I think the interesting thing is that I’m actually not sure how much Waymo is ahead or behind, but I think they’re ahead on the full self-driving front because they’ve got a big team of engineers that are just focused on autonomy. Whereas at Tesla, we got 150,000 people, 140,000 people, something like that. Only about 10,000 of them are involved in full self-driving. The rest are involved in making the cars, the powertrains, the body, the interiors, and so forth.
So, it’s a much smaller team at Tesla than Waymo, but I think Waymo’s probably ahead, based on number of people, but I’m not sure by how much. But I think the interesting thing is that, I think Tesla’s full self-driving is probably ahead of Waymo’s, but I’m not sure by how much.",B,B
No.," None of the car companies. I think the closest would be Waymo, and I think they’re still like at least a year or two away from having a generalized solution.", None that I’m aware of.,B,A
"The other car companies ... I don’t wanna sound overconfident, but I would be very surprised if any of the car companies exceeded Tesla in self-driving, in getting to full self-driving.
You know, I think we’ll get to full self-driving next year. As a generalized solution, I think. But that’s a ... Like, we’re on track to do that next year. So I don’t know. I don’t think anyone else is on track to do it next year.", I think they’re all doing some good things. I think they’re all doing some not so good things.," Yeah. I mean, I’ve driven a Tesla Model S with the performance package. That’s like the best-handling sports car that I know of, and maybe the fastest. The 0 to 60 is like 1.9 seconds or something.",A,B
"They might have sold it, I don’t know.", I think they sold it at a loss.," No, they didn’t.",A,A
"You know ... I mean, as I said earlier this year, I think we will be cash-flow positive for all quarters going forward."," Well, I have a lot of money, and I’m willing to put a lot of money into this. I don’t know if I’ll put in a billion dollars or something like that. I mean, that’s not out of the question. And I’ve got a bunch of options that are expiring early next year that I’m planning to exercise, and that will also provide a lot of money. So I think I can get this to the point where it’s either profitable or at least looking very promising. And then I think I’ll be able to find investors. I mean, I think this is a pretty compelling thing. It’s a pretty compelling idea."," Well, I mean, so far we’ve just been self-funding it. We’ve not taken money from outside investors. And we have a lot of talent and effort, and we’ve been working on it for a long time. But we do expect to at some point need to raise money from outside investors. And we will obviously do that when we feel that it’s… You know, we’ll just raise money when we feel that we need money in order to accelerate progress.",B,A
"No, I don’t think so."," No, I think we’re actually going to have a significant amount of cash."," No, I think we’re actually, right now, we’re roughly cash neutral.",B,B
We don’t need to go private. I think we could execute better if we were private.," No, I don’t think going private is necessarily the right move."," I mean, it’s not super private. It’s like government owned. It’s like the public schools or fire department or something like that.",A,A
"Yeah, you know, not to harp on those short-sellers, because people think I have this obsession with them, but I spent like 1 percent [or] less of time thinking about them —"," Yeah, I mean, it’s just… you know, when you’re public, you have to make every decision considering what is going to make the shareholders happy. And that’s not always what’s good for the company."," Yeah, just a lot less noise.",B,A
"Less than 1 percent of my tweets have anything to do with short-sellers. But the issue is that there’s a group of people who are quite smart, very mean, and have a strong financial interest in Tesla’s downfall.
And what that results in is a constant attack on the Tesla brand, on me personally, on the executive team, on our cars. You know, every mistake we make is amplified.
Going private would definitely result in some short-term drama. Let’s say we’re private, and then we went public five years from now. Then the area under the curve of brand damage by short-sellers would be probably less than the short-term difficulty of going private in the first place. That was the approximate calculus.
And then also being public, particularly when everyone at the company is a shareholder, causes a lot of distraction when the share price moves around a lot. It tends to end up being like a mood, to some degree, a mood thermometer. So it’s like the stock goes down, people are sad and feel undercompensated. And then when the stock goes up, people are exuberant, overly exuberant, and you get distracted thinking about what you’re going to buy."," I mean, I think it’s just like, you know, if you’re going to bet against a company, don’t bet against it publicly. Just, you know, if you’re going to, like, bet against a company, bet against it privately. Don’t bet against it publicly. That’s just, I think, bad karma."," Yeah, it’s the tweets. I mean, I think I’ve said this before, but I do sort of use Twitter like a release valve. And I think, you know, people may not be aware that you can delete tweets. I delete tweets all the time. So it’s not like… I mean, I say things, and I don’t mean them in some sort of a serious way. It’s just, you know, I’m trying to get some laughs.",A,A
"So, like, neither of these things are great. When you have big moves in the stock, this just causes a distraction.", So I think being public is a distraction. And I think it’s actually a bad thing for the company to be public., And then we’re not making cars.,A,A
Ha-ha. We definitely do.," Well, I mean, we’ve got a lot of things. We’ve got the Cybertruck.", We’re working on a robot.,B,A
"The supersonic VTOL jet, electric jet."," No, I don’t think we will do a vertical takeoff and landing."," No, I think that’s a little too far in the future. We need to get the rocket going.",B,A
"No, hovercrafts are pretty straightforward."," No, I would not recommend a hovercraft."," I’ve thought about this a lot. I’ve thought about this a lot. I guess, like, if you get a flying car, you’re still kind of limited by traffic. Like if you have a flying car, you still have to land and take off like a plane. And you’re still limited by the traffic at the airport. So, this is not a solution to traffic. This is only a solution to traffic if you can somehow bypass the traffic at the airport. And most of the airports are really not designed for high throughput.
Like the airports themselves – I’ve joked and said it’s like veal, they’re designed by people who raised veal. It’s like these huge buildings with no windows. And the food is terrible. And the ambiance is depressing. And it’s designed to sort of funnel people through at a slow speed.
So, I think something that… if you could bypass the airport, then a flying car could be useful. But I think the traffic at the airport would still be a problem. So, I’m not sure a flying car would solve traffic. It might help with traffic to the airport. But the traffic at the airport would still be a problem.
I think things that help with vertical takeoff and landing, that’s helpful. If you can go directly from one place to another without having to go to an airport, that would be a big help. And then, the tunnels, I think would help a lot with traffic. So, the tunnels and flying things that avoid airports would help with traffic.",A,A
"A supersonic vertical-takeoff-and-landing electric jet would be interesting to do at some point, I think. But my head would definitely explode if I tried to do that right now.
But I’ve been thinking about that design for nine years. It’s great."," I mean, you can’t just like hover over a city and land on a rooftop or something."," I mean, I think there’s a lot of good things that the government could do. Like, for example, a lot of people don’t have enough money for retirement or healthcare. And that’s pretty terrible. You know, when you get old, and you can’t take care of yourself. Who’s going to take care of you? So, I think, just from a compassion point of view, I mean, that’s like, I don’t want people to just die in the street or something, you know. So, I think, from a compassion point of view, I think the government could do a lot to improve the suffering of the people, you know, the ordinary people, not the wealthy people like me.",A,A
"Yeah. I mean, I wrote down some of it, but ...", Yes., Yes.,=,A
"I think it’s literally the most exciting product lineup of any company in the world. Certainly from a consumer standpoint. I’ll just go through the things that are publicly announced.
You’ve got the Model Y, which is the midsize SUV. You’ve got the Semi truck, which is, can be great for really heavy transport. It’ll be like the heaviest class of truck, of industrial truck.
We’ve got the next-generation Roadster. Which will be the fastest sports car on every dimension. Fastest acceleration, fastest top speed, best handling. It’s important to have an electric sports car that’s faster than the fastest gasoline sports car. And it helps address that halo effect that gasoline sports cars have. So I think it’s important to do that to show that, you know, electric is the best architecture.
Then we’ve got the pickup truck, which — actually, I’m personally most excited about the pickup truck."," Well, I’m not sure exactly when we’ll be able to get the truck going. I think we can probably do that towards the end of this year. And then the Roadster, I think we’re looking at like early next year."," Well, I can’t say exactly when, but we should have something interesting to say about Roadster towards the end of this year.",B,A
"Well I can’t talk about the details, but it’s gonna be like a really futuristic-like cyberpunk, “Blade Runner” pickup truck. It’s gonna be awesome, it’s gonna be amazing. This will be heart-stopping. It stops my heart. It’s like, oh, it’s great."," Well, I love pickup trucks. I think they’re great. And I think there’s a lot of things you can do with a pickup truck that you can’t do with other vehicles. And it’s a very useful thing to have. And I think it’s going to be a really great product.", I’ve wanted to do a pickup truck for a long time. And now we’re finally going to do it. It’s going to be great.,B,B
"You know, I actually don’t know if a lot of people will buy this pickup truck or not, but I don’t care."," Well, I don’t know if they’re actually buying it. It’s like one of those like ‘
Nevada Brothel
’ type situations."," I mean, I don’t know. I just think you should be able to buy a house. If you want a house, you should be able to buy a house.",A,A
"I mean I do care, eventually, you know. Like sure, I care. We wanna get gasoline, diesel pickup trucks off the road.", I don’t care.," I mean, I think if you make a product that’s better than anything else out there and price is not an issue, then I think the company will do well. And if the company does well, then we can make more stuff and employ more people and that will be good. The company will do well and employ a lot of people.",B,B
"It’s something I’ve been wanting to make for a long time. If there’s only a small number of people that like that truck, I guess we’ll make a more conventional truck in the future. But it’s the thing that I am personally most fired up about.", And replace them with electric trucks., And replace them with electric pickup trucks.,B,A
"No. I rode motorbikes a lot when I was a kid. So I did, like, dirt biking and then rode a motorcycle on the road. And then I almost got killed when I was 17. Most people are paralyzed, but depending on how you count it, the probability of death in a motorcycle versus —", I do have a motorcycle., I do.,A,A
It’s 25 times higher., It’s quite high.," Yeah, it’s like 30 times higher than in a car.",B,B
"Yeah. Like organ donors. So, we’re not gonna make motorcycles.
But a few more Tesla products that are cool: We’re almost done with the development of the solar tile roof. So we have those on a few hundred roofs right now. And we’re just doing testing to make sure they have long-term durability."," Donor-mobiles. Yeah, it’s like — You know, it’s like, do they just drive around and collect people?"," Yeah. It’s like the hospital is like, you know, it’s a hospital in a war zone. People are dying left and right and everywhere, and so you just have to sort of make sure that you don’t become a donor.",B,B
"Yeah, the solar tile roof where it looks like a normal, beautiful tile roof. But it’s actually solar. And, like, that development process is longer than we’d like, because we’ve got to make sure that the roof’s gonna stand up for 30 years.", Yeah.," Yeah. We’re going to put solar cells in the tiles. You can see it’s hard to see the solar cell in this picture, but it’s there.",B,B
"And even when you do accelerated lab testing on a solar roof, it still takes a while. And we’ve gotta put a lot of work into making the installation process easy, so it doesn’t take ages to install a roof.
Then we’ve got the Powerwall battery storage system. We’ve got the Powerpack, which is used for utilities on industrial scale. We’re gonna have some other exciting announcements on the stationary storage front. So when you —"," And then, the thing that’s really tricky is to make it look right."," And then, we’re going to go to a new roof. We’re going to take off the old roof, and we’re going to put a solar roof on it. And this is part of the new construction. So, this is all good. And then, we’re going to take the old HVAC system, and we’re going to replace it with a new HVAC system that’s also electric. And this is all good.
And then, we’re going to take the old batteries, and we’re going to recycle them. And this is also good. And then, we’re going to take the new batteries, and we’re going to put them in the car, and in the house. And this is also good.
And then, we’re going to take the old windshield, and we’re going to recycle it. And this is also good. And then, we’re going to take the new windshield, and we’re going to put it on the car. And this is also good.
Except, the new windshield has a heads-up display. And that heads-up display is provided by Tesla. And it’s awesome. And now, the car is awesome. And then, we’re going to take this awesome car, and we’re going to drive it 600 miles without stopping. And that’s also good.
Except, we just took a 300-mile range car, and now, it’s 600-mile range car. And that’s not good. We just made the other cars obsolete. What are we going to do with them? We can’t just – you can’t just let them die. It’s cruel. We’ve got to do something with them. They’re too many cars. What do you do?",A,B
"I can’t talk more about it, but there’s —"," Yeah, this is for homes. This is like a — You know, it’s like a large floor-standing cabinet. It’s like your clothes washer and dryer, sort of size.", Yes.,A,A

"Well, it’d be ironic if that had happened. I have to be careful about tempting fate, because I think often the most ironic outcome is the most probable.
It just very often seems like reality tries to ... Actually, technically, there’s a friend of mine, Jonah Nolan, who had this like modification of Occam’s razor where he said he thinks “the most ironic outcome is the most likely.” And then I think that there’s some truth to that. And then also I think sometimes the most entertaining outcome is the most likely."," I mean, it’s not a joke."," I’m half joking. I mean, I will die, I’m like, I’m not trying to die, but I’m not super worried about it. I mean, I have a lot of faith in the space travel. I think we will get to Mars. I mean, I can’t say exactly when, but we will go to Mars.",B,B
"We successfully launched the Falcon Heavy rocket, which is the most powerful rocket in the world by a factor of two. So that’s twice the power, twice the thrust of the next biggest rocket. And we actually launched a Tesla —myTesla Roadster — to Mars orbit. The reason we did that is actually because, normally, when a new rocket is launched, you just put a dummy payload, which is like a block of concrete or something."," Well, we’re working on a lot of things. We’re trying to make life multi-planetary. We have a lot of work going on with the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets, which are the most complex rockets ever built. And we’re also working on Starship, which is a completely reusable rocket system that will be able to take large amounts of people and cargo to Mars and to the Moon and to other destinations in the solar system."," Well, we’re trying to make the cost of access to orbit be… we’re trying to get the cost of access to orbit be like that of a smart car, which is like $2,000. So, you know, an order of magnitude cheaper. And then we also need to make the rockets reusable. Right now, that is not the case. You can see our rockets coming back and landing – well, not quite yet, but soon we hope.",A,A
"Super-boring. So we were like, okay, what is theleastboring thing we can launch?
And then next year, the exciting things are we’re gonna be launching astronauts for the first time to the space station. It’ll really be the first time a vehicle from the United States launches astronauts into orbit since the Space Shuttle, which —"," Yeah, and it’s just like, “Hey, we got this rocket, it worked.” And then, the rocket will be in orbit around Earth, and then it’ll burn up upon re-entry. But this time, we’re like, “Okay, let’s make it interesting. Let’s put a real payload on there. And let’s send something that’s inspiring to humanity.” So, we put a car on Mars."," And not very inspiring. So, instead, we thought, well, let’s make it inspiring. So, we made a video of this, which has 30 million views and counting. And it’s just like, it’s cool. It’s like, it gets people excited about space, which is great. And we also showed that you can actually put large satellites like the James Webb Telescope with Falcon Heavy. And then we also demonstrated that we can reuse the boost stage. So, the first stage is the big thing that goes at the beginning of the flight. It’s what actually carrying most of the energy to orbit. The upper stage is like the brain and the muscles. The upper stage actually maneuvering the spacecraft, whether it’s putting a satellite in orbit or landing a spacecraft on Mars or something like that.
The boost stage is like the horse in the horse and cart. The horse is still important, but the cart is what really doing the work. So, we showed that we can actually recover the boost stage. In fact, we’ve recovered the boost stage for two different flights now. And on one of those flights, we actually over-recovered the boost stage. We landed it with precision that’s equivalent to landing a 747/737 at the size of a parking lot.",B,A
"2010 or something like that? Since then, the United States has relied upon the Russian Soyuz, which actually recently has had some issues.
What do you think ofthe Space Force? The Trump Space Force?
Well, this may be a little controversial, but I actually like the idea. I think it’s cool. You know, like, when the Air Force was formed, there was a lot of like pooh-poohing, and like, “Oh, how silly to have an Air Force!” You know, because the aircraft in World War II were managed by the Army."," Yeah, it’s been a while."," 2011, so it’s a long time. And we also have the first ever flight of a rocket booster where the rocket booster comes back and lands – not just land but lands precisely at the launch site and then reloads propellant and takes off again, so you have full and rapid reusability. This is gigantic. Normally, a rocket booster falls over somewhere and is lost.",B,B
"And so you had the Army and the Navy and the Coast Guard and the Marines, and then ... it became pretty obvious that you really needed a specialized division to manage aircraft. And so the Air Force was created.
And people today may not realize back then it was wildly panned as a ridiculous thing to create the Air Force, but now everyone’s like, “Obviously, you should have an Air Force.” And I think it’s gonna become obvious that we should have a Space Force, too."," And they were just like, “Oh, we don’t need a separate Air Force. That’s silly.” But then, obviously, once aircraft could go higher and faster than the speed of bullets, then it was like, “Okay, it’s pretty important to have a separate Air Force.” I think the same is true for space. You know, the things that we’re doing with SpaceX, the things that Blue Origin are doing, the things that Boeing and Lockheed are doing – these are important things that are going to affect the future of humanity, really. I think it’s pretty exciting."," And the Air Corps or whatever it was called at the time was kind of a second-class citizen in the military. And then, when they formed the Air Force, it was like, “Okay, now the Air Force has primacy over the Army, and they can do whatever they want with aircraft.” I think this is a good thing. You know, the Space Force, it’s just a question of time before there’s a Space Force. We might as well make it happen.",A,A
"You know, it’s basically defense in space. And then I think also it could be pretty helpful for maybe expanding our civilization ... You know, expanding things beyond Earth.
I think we could just have a base on the moon, for example. A base on Mars. Be great to expand on the idea of a Space Force. Anyone who has an exploratory spirit, and I think that especially applies to a country like the United States, where you know it’s kind of the distillation of the spirit of human exploration. I think the idea of being out there among the stars and among the planets is very exciting."," Well, I think we want to be careful about having a lot of civilizational eggs in one basket. And right now, I think we have a lot of eggs in the basket of Earth. And so, if we want to have a secure future, I think we want to have a self-sustaining city on Earth and a self-sustaining city in space. And I think we want to have that as soon as possible. I mean, I’m pro-humanity, so I’d like to see us be a multi-planet species."," Well, I mean, we’re really just trying to set the stage for the future. The future we see is one where humanity expands beyond Earth, where we’re a spacefaring civilization and out there among the stars. And we want to make sure that that future is one that is welcoming and one that we want to be around. And if we don’t take these steps to make sure that that future is welcoming and one that we want to be around, then it’s going to be ominous.",B,B
"Yeah, we’re still aiming for 2024."," Yeah, I mean, I think we have a good chance of putting people on Mars in 2029."," Yes, 2024.",B,B
"I don’t know if I will go or not. It may be just an unmanned mission, you know. I’m not sure if there’ll be people onboard or not.
But there is a Mars rendezvous opportunity, ’cause you can only do a launch to Mars roughly every two years. So around the 2024 timeframe, there’s a rendezvous opportunity for Mars, which hopefully we can catch. There’s one in 2022 —"," I mean, I’ll go at some point."," I mean, I’ll go at least once. And it’s not super cheap. So, you know, it’s like, it costs a lot of money to go to Mars.",B,A
"Hopefully, there are people on board. But I think there’s a pretty good chance of at least having an unmanned craft go to Mars. I think we will try to do this."," I mean, I think we should try to send an unmanned vehicle there. Yeah.", I think the first flight to Mars will be unmanned.,B,A
"Yeah, I certainly think NASA should continue to exist, NASA does a lot of really useful things, and these go beyond astronaut transport. There are missions to rovers on Mars that are thanks to NASA. There are these planetary probes, there’s the Hubble Telescope. NASA does a tremendous amount of good, and ideally we should actually increase the budget of NASA. I think it’s high time that we went beyond Earth orbit again. I think it’s very exciting and inspiring, and I think it really gets the whole world fired up.
When the first humans stepped foot on the Moon, it was probably the most inspiring thing, maybe in history? We should try to do more of that stuff.", I think they should exist. I think they should have a budget. I think they should have a mandate to do things. But I think they should not have a mandate to waste money.," Well, I think right now, NASA is doing a good job.

"Yeah, I think it’s great that Jeff is spending lots of money on space. I think it will encounter some challenges getting to orbit; it’s remarkably difficult getting to orbit. But he has the resources to overcome those difficulties. He’s got some spare change in the couch, I think.", I think it’s great that he’s doing it. I think it’s great that there’s competition. I think it’s good for the future of space that there be a lot of companies. I think SpaceX has done more to advance the cause of humanity becoming a spacefaring civilization than anyone else. But I think it would be great if there were other companies that were also doing it. And Blue Origin is one of those companies.," Well, I don’t know exactly what he’s doing. I know he wants to do it. I don’t know if he’s got the resources to do it. I don’t know if he’s got the talent. I don’t know if he’s got the will. I don’t know what his situation is. But I think I’d like to be… I’d like to not be the only person doing this.
I’d like there to be a lot of people doing it. Because what will happen, I think, probably is that there will be a lot of companies with suborbital capabilities. And then there will be a select few with orbital capabilities. And the price of access to orbit will plummet. I think we’re headed towards a situation where access to orbit is like a ride on a roller coaster. It will be like a thrill ride.",A,A
"No, I don’t generally acquire things.", No., No.,=,A
"I create companies, but I don’t really acquire them. So I wouldn’t ... I have no plans. It does seem to be popular these days.
So let’s finish up the last two things. Boring Company,I was just with Eric Garcetti in Los Angeles—
Oh, great, yeah. Eric’s been a great supporter.", I don’t think I would be allowed to., I don’t have a watch.,A,A
"Yeah, Eric’s been really supportive of our activity in L.A. I mean, technically, our first tunnels are in Hawthorne. But we do expect to, over time, create a network of tunnels under greater L.A. And I think this is really the key to getting around the city very fast. You’ve got to go 3-D. Our offices are 3-D and dense, but we then have a 2-D road transport network."," Yeah, I mean, it’s pretty crazy. I mean, I was in LA for 15 years, and I’ve been to LA since I was a kid. And it’s just like, it’s always been bad, but it’s like worse. It’s like, it’s a lot worse."," I mean, I think it’s pretty great that the mayor of LA is pro-tunnel. That’s great. You know, we’re going to do a tunnel under L.A. to alleviate traffic, and we’re also going to do a loop for the hyperloop. So you can just go from one place to another in L.A. without using any energy, just using electric motors.
And then we’re also going to do a connection to the airport. So you can just take a hyperloop to the airport. You don’t need a car, and you don’t need a plane. This is great. So I’m confident that we’ll get something done in L.A.
Somewhere between 2020 and 2030. It’s not a super high priority relative to other things, but it is a priority. And I think we’ll get it done. And then we’ll do it in other cities as well.
So, what’s the question?",B,B
"Yeah, many levels of tunnels, so —"," Yeah, you can’t have a tunnel with just one road in it.", It’s an underground network of tunnels.,B,A
"Yeah, but even subways tend to be essentially two-dimensional. You’ll have a subway cross another subway, but they’ve never really tried to make many layers of subways. The cost of tunneling, historically, has been prohibitive. And they’ve also been incredibly slow. The typical cost for a subway, per-mile cost for a subway in the U.S. has been about a billion dollars a mile, so that is not a very scalable solution."," Yeah, it’s just that this would be a subway system that is 3D. So, instead of having two levels, you could have 100 levels, and so it can alleviate any traffic that you could possibly imagine."," Yeah, it will be faster than the subway, I promise.",A,A
"You could certainly have a subway system which had many layers of tunnels, but the tunnels are so prohibitively expensive that they don’t do it. But you can go down 100 levels if you want to; you could have 100 layers of tunnels on top of each other. You can go further down than you can go up. So the deepest mines are much deeper than the tallest buildings. But, really, the key is a massive improvement in tunneling technology. That’s the linchpin, that’s fundamentally what it amounts to. And as I got sort of digging into tunnels ... Ha-ha, good one."," Yeah, tunnels."," Yeah, it’s got to be tunnels.",B,B
"Yeah, yeah, no, I’ve got a million of ’em."," Yeah, I do that a lot."," It’s pretty funny. Can’t help it.
(laughs)",B,A
Tunnels are really so underappreciated. They have no place to go but down., Yeah.," Yeah, like, literally, the soil is like one inch deep, and then it just goes down far.",B,B

I think the most important thing for the Saudi situation is for them to show that they are able to solve the Khashoggi thing to the satisfaction of the world. And I think they’re probably doing that. I don’t know. I don’t know what will happen. I think we’re kind of in a world where there’s a lot of geopolitical uncertainty.
