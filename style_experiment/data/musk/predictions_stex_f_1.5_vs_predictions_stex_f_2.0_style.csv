Thanks for having me., My pleasure.," Hey, thanks for having me.",B,B
"Well, first of all, I think if somebody is doing something that is useful to the rest of society, I think that's a good thing. Like, it doesn't have to change theworld. If you make something that has high value to people... And frankly, even if it's something, if it's like just a little game or some improvement in photo sharing or something, if it has a small amount of good for a large number of people, It hink that's fine. Stuff doesn't need to change the world just to be good. But in terms of things that I think are most like to affect the future of humanity, I think AI is probably the single biggest item in the near-term that's likely to affect humanity. So, it's very important that we have the advent of AI in a good way. It's something that, if you could look into the crystal ball and to the future, you would like that outcome because it is something that could go wrong, as we've talked about many times. And so, we really need to make sure it goes right. So that's AI,working on AI and making sure it's great future. That's the most important thing, It hink, right now, the most pressing item. Then, I would say anything to do with genetics. If you can actually solve genetic diseases, if you can prevent dementia or Alzheimer's or something like that with genetic reprograming, that would be wonderful. So I think genetics might be the sort of second most important item. And then, I think, having a high-bandwidth interface to the brain. We're currently bandwidth-limited. We have a digital tertiary self in the form of out email capabilities, our computers, phones, applications. We're practically superhuman. But we're extremely bandwidth-constrained in that interface between the cortex and that tertiary digital form of yourself. And helping solve that bandwidth constraint would be, I think, very important in the future as well. Yeah."," Well, I guess, working on solutions for existential risks for humanity, I think is something that I would work on. I think there’s a pretty good chance that we find some good solutions to the energy problems of the world, and we’re seeing that with the rapid growth of solar and wind. So that’s a good trend.
I think there’s still a lot of work to be done in developing sustainable energy solutions for the developing world. So that’s a big challenge. Sustainable energy solutions for high population density areas, like the Middle East, where you’ve got a lot of sun, but you don’t have a lot of space, and you’ve got a lot of people, so you need to really cram a lot of energy into a small space.
I think there’s a big challenge in the future of developing a sustainable energy transport system. So like, how do you make electric planes and supersonic electric jets and that kind of thing. And then, of course, there’s the challenge of becoming a multi-planet species and a spacefaring civilization. So I think those are all pretty exciting things."," Well, I’m not 22 anymore. I’m 51.",A,A
"Well, first of all, I should say that I do not expect to be involved in all these things. So, the five things that I thought about at the time in college, so quite along time ago, 25 years ago, making life multi-planetary, accelerating the transmission to sustainable energy, the Internet broadly speaking, and then genetics, and AI. I didn't expect to be involved in all those things. Actually, at the time in college, I sort of thought helping with electrification of cars was how it would start out. That's actually what I worked on as an intern was advanced ultra-capacitors, to see if there would be a breakthrough relative to batteries for energy storage in cars. And then, when I came out to go to Stanford, that's what I was going to be doing my grad studies on was working on advanced energy storage technologies for electric cars. And I put that on hold to start an Internet company in '95 because there does seem to be a time for particular technologies when they're at a steep point in the inflection curve. And I didn't want to do a PHD atStanford and watch it all happen. I wasn't entirely certain that the technology I'd be working on would succeed. You can get a doctorate on many things that ultimately do not a have practical bearing on the world. And I really was just trying to be useful. That's the optimization. It's like, ""What can I do that would actually be useful?"""," I was always curious about how things work. And I think that's pretty common. Kids are always asking, ""Why is it like that?"" And I think it's good to just be exposed to a lot of different things. I think I read a lot of books, and my parents took me on a lot of trips. And we went to Canada, and we went to the US, and we went to Mexico, and we went to Europe. And we just saw a lot of different things, and I was exposed to a lot of different cultures, and I think that was helpful. And then, I think, just generally, I was always interested in the future. I thought about the future a lot. And I was always trying to figure out, like, what are the things that would be the things that would affect the future in a big way. And then, I would try to read a lot about those things. And then, I would try to do things in that area.
So, like, one example is, I was trying to figure out what would affect the future in a big way. And I thought, well, the internet is something that's going to be big. And then, I tried to figure out, well, what's the most important thing on the internet? And I thought, well, the most important thing on the internet is going to be the thing that helps you find the most useful information, the fastest. And then, I realized that the way to do that is to figure out what questions you should ask. And then, the answers to those questions would be the most useful information. So then, I worked on a software called 'Questions and Answers' to try to figure out what are the right questions to ask. And then, you connect those questions to the answers. And then, you get better answers by iterating on the questions and the answers. And then, you can also see how other people have answered a question, and you can see how they've ranked relative to other people. And then, you can also see how you rank relative to other people. And so, it's a way of sort of self-improvement, also.
And then, I thought, well, what's the most important question to answer? I think the most important question to answer is, ""What is the nature of the universe?"" And then, I realized that in order to answer the question, what is the nature of the universe, you actually have to answer two questions. One is, what is the nature of physics? And then, what is the meaning of life, or what is the purpose of life? And then, I realized that these are the two hardest questions in the universe. And then, I realized that there was a third question, which is, how can we expand the scope and scale of consciousness? And then, I realized that these were actually the three hardest questions in the universe. And then, I realized that there was actually a fourth question, which is, how can we ensure the future is good, ensure that civilization continues, and that the sort of small candle of consciousness in the void that is humanity continues and that the candle does not go out."," I think, like, a lot of people can have a big impact. I just happened to have a big impact. But I think if you work on things that are useful to other people, so if you sort of do engineering that is useful, or if you’re in medicine and you’re helping cure diseases or doing something to improve the productivity of the world or solving a problem that is important for the future of humanity, then you can have a very big impact. And I think most people can have a big impact if they just work on things that are useful to other people. And just keep doing that, just keep doing useful things. And then, the impact will be commensurate with the usefulness of the thing and the scope. Like, if it’s a thing that is useful to a large number of people or to all people, then your scope will be all people. And that’s basically what I did. I just kept doing useful things. And then, the scope just expanded naturally.",B,A
Mostly not., I think it's not necessary.," I think it's not necessary to get a PhD in order to be useful. I would encourage people to read a lot of books, basically try to internalize as much knowledge as possible, and try to be useful. I think that's the best thing that you can do.",A,A
"Some yes, but mostly not.", I don’t know. Useful to who?, I don’t know. That’s up to other people to decide. I’m just going to try to make it last as long as possible and hand it off to someone who can make it last even longer.,B,A
"Well, I think you make some estimates of, whatever this thing is that you're trying to create, what would be the utility delta compared to the current state of the art times how many people it would affect. So that's why I think having something that makes a big difference but affects sort of small to moderate number of people is great, as is something that makes even a small difference but affects a vast number of people. Like, the area under the curve."," I don’t know. Usefulness is, I think, somewhat overrated. I think the things that really matter are love and beauty and things like that. And if you get into the mindset of trying to be useful, I think you’re going to be pretty sad because you’re going to be — I mean, what is useful anyway? Useful to whom?", Try to have a positive impact on the world.,A,A
"Yeah, exactly. I mean, the area under the curve would actually be roughly similar for those two things, so it's actually really about just trying to be useful and matter."," Yeah, just have a high leverage."," Yeah, because you can have something that saves a million lives, but if it only affects 10 people, it’s not really that big of a deal. But if it affects 10 million people, that’s a big deal.",B,B
"Very crazy. For sure. They were not shy of saying that. But I agreed with them that it was quite crazy. Crazy...if the objective was to achieve the best risk-adjusted return, starting off a company is insane. But that was not my objective. I'd soon come to a conclusion that if something didn't happen to improve rocket technology, we'd be stuck on earth forever. And the big aerospace companies had just had no interest in radical innovation. All they wanted to do was try tomake their old technology slightly better every year. And in fact, sometimes it would actually get worse. Particularly in rockets, it was pretty bad. In '69 we were able to go to the moon with the Saturn 5. And then the space shuttle could onlytake people to low-earth orbit. And then the space shuttle retired. And that trend basically trends to zero. People sometimes think technology just automatically gets better every year but actually it doesn't. It only gets better if smart people work like crazy to make it better. That's how any technology actually gets better. By itself, technology, if people don't work at it, actually will decline. Look at the history of civilizations,many civilizations. Look at, say, ancient Egypt, where they were able to build these incredible pyramids and then they basically forgot how to build pyramids. And even hieroglyphics. They forgot how to read hieroglyphics. Or if you look atRome and how they were able to build these incredible roadways and aqueduct sand indoor plumbing, they forgot how to do all of those things. There are many such examples in history. So I think we should always bear in mind that entropy is not on your side.", Yes.," 2001

"Well, first of all I'd say I actually think I feel fear quite strongly. So it's not as though I just have the absence of fear. I feel it quite strongly. There are just times when something is important enough that you believe in it enough that you do it in spite of fear."," I mean, I'm not saying I'm fearless. I mean, I certainly have fear. It's just that the fear is not always stopping me. And I think there's a difference between being afraid and not doing something and not being afraid and doing something. I mean, I certainly have fear. I mean, I'm not sure I'd actually do some of the things I've done if I was not afraid. But I mean, the point at which you have fear and you don't do something, that's one thing. But if you have fear and you do something, that's a different thing."," I think I have actually a fairly low fear of danger. I don’t know what the exact word is. But I’m not a risk averse person. And I think that the things that I’ve done, in order to do something… like, say, launching SpaceX or Tesla, or taking over as CEO of PayPal, which was really an extremely difficult situation to take over as CEO of a public company, especially if you’re not from the Valley, which I wasn’t, really no one knew who I was. I was just some Canadian guy. And now let’s see, we’ll go to Mars. I’m not sure if this is normal or not. I don’t know what the normal… I don’t know what the bell curve looks like for, say, executives or something. But if you’re at the far extreme of anything, you’re going to be, you know, to the right or to the left of the bell curve. I’m probably to the left, but quite a bit.
Or another way to think about it is that most people are kind of in the bell curve. The normal distribution. But there’s a few people that are to the left of the bell curve, and a few people that are to the right of the bell curve. And most people are just kind of in the middle. But if you’re in the top one or two percent, you’re to the right of the bell curve. And if you’re in the bottom one or two percent, you’re to the left of the bell curve. I think I’m probably, like I said, a little bit to the left of the bell curve, but more than most people, for sure.",A,A
"It's like, people shouldn't think, well, ""I feel fear about this and therefore I shouldn't do it,"" it's normal to feel fear. Like, you'd have to have something mentally wrong with you if you don't feel fear."," I mean, I'm not saying I'm right about everything. But I think it's just, there's a lot of things that are important that are not right.", I think the battle for the future of civilization is the battle between physics and psychology. Physics is the law and psychology is the squirm.,A,A
"Yeah. You know, actually something that can be helpful is fatalism, to some degree. If you just accept the probabilities, then that diminishes fear. When starting SpaceX, I thought the odds of success were less than 10% and I just accepted that actually probably I would just lose everything. But that maybe would make some progress. If we could just move the ball forward, even if we died, maybe some other company could pick up the baton and keep moving it forward, so we'd still do some good. Yeah, same with Tesla. I thought the odds ofa car company succeeding were extremely low.", Yeah., Yeah.,B,A
"Well, oddly enough, I actually think they're pretty good."," Well, I mean, the Mars city is, I think, a much more likely outcome than a Mars colony. I think we can have a Mars city, like a self-sustaining city on Mars, in this century. The critical threshold is with the current technology, you can get things to Mars, but you can’t get them back. So, if you have a one-way trip, people are unlikely to go. But if you have a two-way trip, people are more likely to go. And you need a certain amount of infrastructure on Mars before you can have a two-way trip because you need to be able to get back to Earth if something goes wrong on Mars.
So, the Mars city is, I think, very likely in this century. I’d be disappointed if it didn’t happen in this century. And then, the Mars colony is when the per capita income on Mars exceeds that of Earth, and people can afford to go to Mars and live there. That’s probably a much more distant future, but I think we should have a Mars city as a backstop civilization. Just in case something goes wrong on Earth, we have a backstop civilization on Mars. And we should also have a backstop civilization on the Moon. And we’re working on a backstop civilization on the Moon as well with Starship."," Well, I think there’s a good chance it happens in my lifetime.",B,B
"I hope I'm not in some realm of self-delusion here. But look at it this way: at this point, I'm certain there is a way. I'm certain that success is one of possible outcomes for establishing a self-sustaining Mars colony, a growing Mars colony. I'm certain that is possible. Whereas until maybe a few years ago, I was not sure that success was even one of the possible outcomes. In terms of having some meaningful number of people going to Mars, I think this is potentially something that can be accomplished in about 10 years. Maybe sooner, maybe nine years. Indeed to make sure that SpaceX doesn't die between now and then and that I don't die, or if I do die, that someone takes over who will continue that."," Well, I think we should really try hard to make it happen in this century; before the end of the century."," Sure. Just fill out this form. And we’ll get it notarized, and you’re good to go.",A,A
"Yeah, exactly. The first launch will be robotic anyway.", I will go on the first launch., I will probably go on the second launch.,B,A
"Yeah, the internet latency would be pretty significant. Mars is roughly 12 light minutes from the sun and Earth is 8 light minutes. So, the closest approach to Mass is four light minutes away. The furthest approach is 20. A little more because you can't sort of talk directly through the sun."," Yeah, it’s going to be great."," Yeah, that’s going to be really good.",B,A
"Okay, I mean I do want to emphasize that this is not really something that I advocate or this is not prescriptive. This is simply, hopefully, predictive. Because you will hear some say, well, like this is something that I want to occur instead of this is something I think that probably is the best of the available alternatives. The best of the available alternatives that I can come up with, and maybe someone else can come up with a better approach or better outcome, is that we achieve democratization of AI technology. Meaning that no one company or small set of individuals has control over advanced AI technology. I think that's very dangerous. It could also get stolen by somebody bad, like some evil dictator or country could send their intelligence agency to go steal it and gain control. It just becomes a very unstable situation, I think, if you've got any incredibly powerful AI. You just don't know who's going to control that. So it's not that I think that the risk is that the AI would develop a will of its own right off the bat. I think the concern is that someone may use it in a way that is bad. Or even if they weren't going to use it in a way that's bad but somebody could take it from them and use it in a way that's bad, that, I think, is quite a big danger. So I think we must have democratization of AI technology to make it widely available. And that's the reason that obviously you, me, and the rest of the team created OpenAI was to help spread out AI technology so it doesn't get concentrated in the hands of a few. But then, of course, that needs to be combined with solving the high-bandwidth interface to the cortex."," I’m optimistic about AI. I think it will be the case that AI will be able to understand the world better than humans and will be able to take actions in the world better than humans. Now, the point at which an AI can do something that a human cannot do to stop it, that’s where things get spooky. But I think the probability of an AI dystopian outcome is actually quite low."," Well, I’ve said for a long time, I think AI safety is a really big deal. And we should have some regulatory agency that is overseeing AI safety. But there is not yet currently any such thing, and just generally, any kind of regulatory agency run by the government usually takes years to put in place. So, you know, after the population collapse issue, I think AI safety is probably the second biggest threat to the future of civilization. And yeah, like I said, I’m not quite sure what to do with it.
I mean, I’ve been saying for a while now that, you know, an agency that is overseeing AI safety should really be established. And if no one else does it, we will do it. Because we have AI, and we have a lot of smart people, and we have the data. We have more data than anyone else, and we’ve got a lot of smart people, and we got the hardware. So we can actually run large scale, small scale, any scale AI. And we’ve got a lot of smart people at it. So we could certainly do that. I’d much rather someone else does it.",A,B
"Humans are so slow. Yes, exactly. But we already have a situation in ourb rain where we've got the cortex and the limbic system... The limbic system is kind of a...I mean, that's the primitive brain. That's kind of like your instincts and whatnot. And the cortex is the thinking upper part of the brain. Those two seem to work together quite well. Occasionally, your cortex and limbic system will disagree, but they..."," Yeah, we're really slow."," We’re so slow, and our memory is so terrible.",A,B
"Generally works pretty well, and it's like rare to find someone who...I've notfound someone wishes to either get rid of the cortex or get rid of the limbic system."," Yes, it does. Most of the time, they're in agreement."," Yeah, it does. I mean, the limbic system is kind of the part that really wants to get things done. That's why, like, you'll have, like, a strong physical urge to, you know, have food or to have sex or to do something about a threat. The cortex is kind of the part that's able to plan and think and understand concepts. So you need both. You need the cortex and the limbic system.",B,B
"Yeah, that's unusual. So I think if we can effectively merge with AI by improving the neural link between your cortex and your digital extension of yourself, which already, like I said, already exists, just has a bandwidth issue. And then effectively you become an AI-human symbiote. And if that then is widespread, with anyone who wants it can have it, then we solve the control problem as well, we don't have to worry about some evil dictator AI because we are the AI collectively. That seems like the best outcome I can think of.", People are generally pretty happy with their mind and their body.," It's like, these are the tools of human will, and people want to use them.",B,B
I think it's going pretty well. I think we've got a really talented group at OpenAI., I think OpenAI is doing great., I don’t know. I think it’s going pretty well so far.,A,B
"Yeah, a really talented team and they're working hard. OpenAI is structured as a 501(c)(3) non-profit. But many non-profits do not have a sense of urgency. It's fine, they don't have to have a sense of urgency, but OpenAI does because I think people really believe in the mission. I think it's important. And it's about minimizing the risk of existential harm in the future. And so I think it's going well. I'm pretty impressed with what people are doing and the talent level. And obviously, we're always looking for great people to join in the mission."," Yeah, it seems like it."," Yeah, seems like it.",B,A
"My time is mostly split between SpaceX and Tesla. And of course, I try to spend a part of every week at OpenAI. So I spend basically half a day at OpenAI most weeks. And then I have some OpenAI stuff that happens during the week.But other than that, it's really SpaceX and Tesla."," Well, it's changed quite a lot over time. I used to spend a lot of time on SpaceX and Tesla, and now I spend most of my time on Neuralink and Twitter. And, in fact, those two full-time, and then I have some free time. And I also still have some stock options that vest in Tesla and SpaceX, and I still go to the Tesla and SpaceX factories on occasion and just work on things. I'm not formally the CEO of Tesla or SpaceX anymore, but I still have a lot of respect for the people there and I still want to help make the products better. So I go and give them feedback and help with product design and that kind of thing.
But Twitter and Neuralink are taking up most of my time. And I'm also studying a lot. I'm trying to learn a lot of things. I hired a tutor to help me learn quantum mechanics. I'm trying to learn more about artificial intelligence. I'm reading a lot of books on philosophy and history. And just trying to be useful and do good for the future.", I’m up at 5 am and work until 11 pm. I work seven days a week. I’m either working or spending time with my kids. That’s pretty much it. I’m not much of a TV watcher. It’s work or family.,B,B
"Yes, it's a good question. I think a lot of people think I must spend a lot of time with media or on businessy things. But actually almost all my time, like 80% of it, is spent on engineering and design. Engineering and design, so it's developing next-generation product. That's 80% of it."," Well, at Tesla, I spend a lot of time on engineering and manufacturing. So I'm out on the factory floor a lot. I think that's really important. I spend a lot of time with the engineering team. I'm not out there as much at SpaceX because it's in South Texas. It's about an hour's flight from here. So I go there probably once a week. And then at Tesla, I'm usually there all day."," Well, it's a lot of meetings. It's talking to the teams, getting updates, providing feedback, making decisions. There's a lot of engineering that's going on. There's a lot of interesting advanced manufacturing techniques that we're developing. And we're trying to set production records every week at both companies. So it's a lot of that, and then there's a lot of design work. I spend a lot of time on product design.",B,B
"Yeah. I think a lot of people think I'm kind of a business person or something, which is fine. Business is fine. But really it's like at SpaceX, Gwynne Shotwell is Chief Operating Officer. She manages legal, finance, sales, and general business activity. And then my time is almost entirely with the engineering team, working on improving the Falcon 9 and our Dragon spacecraft and developing the Mars Colonial architecture. At Tesla, it's working on the Model3 and, yeah, so I'm in the design studio, take up a half a day a week, dealing with aesthetics and look-and-feel things. And then most of the rest of the week is just going through engineering of the car itself as well as engineering of the factory. Because the biggest epiphany I've had this year is that what really matters is the machine that builds the machine, the factory. And that is at least two orders of magnitude harder than the vehicle itself.", I was obsessed. I still am obsessed., I try to be the master of at least one thing.,B,A
"Yeah. Now, this actually has a relatively lower level of automation compared to what the Gigafactory will have and what Model 3 will have.", It's like magic.," It’s amazing to see it. It’s something special. You know, it’s magic basically.",B,A
"Actually our speed on the line is incredibly slow. I think we are...in terms of the extra velocity of vehicles on the line, it's probably about, including both X andS, it's maybe five centimeters per second. This is very slow."," Well, it’s about 100 cars a day."," Well, we’re making some improvements to it. Currently, it’s about 100 cars per hour, and we think we can get it to 200 cars per hour. The key to a high-performance manufacturing line is accomplishing a high percentage of processes while in motion. If you have to stop the line, then that line speed drops dramatically. So getting the processes that are time-consuming and have to be done in motion, getting those optimized for high-speed manufacturing is really the key.
And then it’s also important to have a wide line. So, think of a factory as being like a highway. You can go very fast on the highway, but you can’t go fast if you’ve got a lot of cars in the lane. So having many lines, having a wide line, is important for high productivity. And then the other thing is to have a factory that’s 24/7. We’re planning to have the Berlin Giga-factory to be a 24/7 operation.",B,A
"I'm confident we can get to at least one meter per second. So, a 20-fold increase."," Well, I think, you know, just have the cars just go, go, go. The only time they stop is when they go through the automated parking, and even in the automated parking, we’re getting it to the point where it can just, you know, do a high-speed, high-precision parking."," I mean, ideally, you’d want to be on the fast lane, which is, you know, 100 kilometers an hour plus. Ideally, you want to be able to go from one interchange to the next, which is like 100 kilometers, let’s say 120 kilometers an hour. And then you can get on the highway, and you can just go for a very long time. And most of the time, you’re probably not going to be going at the top speed. So, you’d be able to go from, say, 0 to 60 in, let’s say, 1.9 seconds, which is a 0 to 60 of 1.9 is 190 miles an hour.",B,B
"Yeah. At least. I mean, I think quite a...one meter per second, just to put into perspective, is a slow walk or a medium-speed walk. A fast walk could be one and a half meters per second. And then the fastest humans can run over 10 meters per second."," Yes, it's very fast."," 200 kilometers an hour. You can get from Westwood to LAX in six minutes – five, six minutes.",B,B
Elon Musk:What’s Twitter?, I’ve made many mistakes., What?,B,B
"Well, I tweet interesting things pretty much as they come to me, and probably with not much of a filter."," Well, I think I have an unhealthy relationship with Twitter. I think I should probably use it less. But I do enjoy using Twitter. I think it’s a fun thing. I mean, I’ve been asked, “Why do you use Twitter?” And I’m like, “It’s like, I just like the taste of it.” I think it’s good. I think it’s fun. I like interacting with people on Twitter. I know it’s a lot of people that tweet at me, and there’s a lot of negative feedback, but there’s also a lot of positive feedback, and a lot of people who enjoy interacting with each other on Twitter.
So I think it’s good. I think it’s fun. I do want to say, I have been told that my feedback loop is too strong, where I get too much feedback. I’m trying to, you know, work on that. Because I think it is actually a bit of an issue. I get too much feedback."," Well, I think I said some people use Twitter as a… it’s like a fear machine, and they use it to pump out fear. And I think there’s also, I think some people use it to pump out hate, and I think that’s not good. So I think it’s important for the sort of major social media companies to do everything they can to stop the use of their systems for spreading hate and fear.",B,A
"I find it entertaining. I think, “Oh, other people might find this entertaining.” Sometimes they do.", I think it’s a good way to get a message out.," I think I said I stopped using it because I felt like it was being used by the media to bully people, including me, and people that are not public figures. And I think that’s not good. I think bullying is not good. So I stopped using it for that reason. And then I said that I would only come back to Twitter if there was an extreme commitment to making it a force for good, and that the prior management had shown that they were not a force for good, and that the new management, the X management, was committed to making it a force for good. And I believe that they have given me a credible answer in that regard. So that’s why I’m back on Twitter.",A,A
Yeah. Mostly at home. I spend a lot less time on Twitter than people probably think. It’s like maybe 10-15 minutes or something.," Yeah, it’s kind of like a fun thing to do. I do it for fun."," Yeah, at night.",A,A

Terrible people."," I think the press often is sloppy and is, in my experience, more interested in getting a scoop than in the truth. And I think that this is a problem. And I think that there’s an over-reliance on anonymous sources and an over-reliance on what I think are basically leaks. And that’s not good."," I think, in general, the press is taken for granted. They have a lot of power, and they don’t use it responsibly in general.

And the mayors of these cities, the district attorneys of these cities refuse to do anything about it. They won’t enforce the law. And they’re the ones who are actually putting people in prison. The police can’t put anyone in prison. The prosecutors put people in prison. And they refuse to prosecute a lot of crimes. And they’re setting very low bonds for crimes. That’s what’s causing crime.
And then the courts are letting people go. The judges are letting people go. This is a huge problem. And the mayors and the district attorneys refuse to do anything about it. They are the ones causing crime. If you want to stop crime, you should be arresting the mayors and district attorneys that are causing crime. That’s my recommendation.",A,A
No.," I think we’re not the enemy of the people, but he doesn’t like negative news."," No, I don’t. I obviously disagree with a lot of the things that Donald Trump says.

"Yeah. There are good journalists and there are bad ones, and unfortunately the feedback loop for good versus bad is inverted, so the more salacious that an article is, the more salacious the headline is, the more clicks it’s gonna get.

"No. Of course not. Count how many negative articles there are and how many I respond to. One percent, maybe. But the common rebuttal of journalists is, “Oh. My article’s fine.

I mean, I think there’s a little bit of a difference between criticism and hateful content, and I’m certainly not advocating putting stuff that is hateful, meaning it’s just… it should be on the platform, it’s public domain, but it doesn’t mean that I have to click on it. I don’t have to give it a thumbs up or promote it in any way. So there’s a difference, I think, between, say, if there’s some… Let’s say, there’s some web site that is just… has some false information about me, it’s not hateful, it’s just false. Do I want to promote that? No. I don’t want to put a thumb up to that. But it’s not hateful, it’s just wrong.",B,B

How do you think rockets get to orbit?," I think we should not make this a constant topic, but I think there are many examples of where the media will publish something that is not true and then correct it later. That happens quite a bit."," Well, I mean, I think people don’t understand the cathode. They think it’s simple. They don’t understand the challenges of achieving high aspect ratio with a cathode. The amount of stress that puts on the tab and the backing is crazy. If you get a tab that’s 100 millimeters long and a mile wide – okay, not a mile, let’s say 100 millimeters, that’s really 100 millimeters – and try and just curl that up onto a flat surface and not have it crack, it’s very difficult.
So, there are a number of ways to address this, but they’re all cost and performance trades. There’s no free lunch. You can’t just make a part that’s super high aspect ratio without making some sacrifices on cost and/or performance. So, there are, I think, some very good choices that we’ve made that other people haven’t made. And then the details…  the devil’s in the details. The details are hard.
But I think we have the best cathode approach of anyone – of any company – in the world. And the details, man, the details are hard. That’s what I was trying to convey. It’s like, there are these obvious choices, but then you have to actually make them work, and that’s the hard part.",B,A

"Pretty sure I burnt out a bunch of neurons during this process. Running both SpaceX and Tesla is an incredibly difficult ... You realize we’re fighting the incredibly competitive car companies. They make very good cars. They’ve been doing this for a long time. They are entrenched. Mercedes, Audi, BMW, Lexus, you name it. All those car brands. And the history of car companies in America is terrible. The only ones that haven’t gone bankrupt are Tesla and Ford. That’s it. Everyone else has gone bankrupt."," Yeah, so I think I’ve spoken about this before, but the Model 3 production was extremely difficult. We had a very good product in the Model S and X, and a good car in the Model 3. But the Model 3 was a much harder car to make, and it was also a much more expensive car to make. It was really a very difficult thing to do. But we got it done, and I think it’s gone pretty well. The Model 3 is now the bestselling car in the world."," Well, the Model 3 program was a very difficult program. I’d say that the Model 3 program was, for me, easily the most difficult thing I’ve ever done in my life. Period. And I’ve done a lot of things. I’ve run companies, public and private.

Ford and Tesla made it barely through the last recession. There’s a good chance Ford doesn’t make it in the next recession. So, as a startup, a car company, it is far more difficult to be successful than if you’re an established, entrenched brand. It is absurd that Tesla is alive. Absurd!

But they’re not sure they can survive if they don’t sell gasoline cars. Or if they’re not sure they can survive if they’re not selling cars at all. Or if they’re not able to sell enough cars at high enough prices to support their stock price. Because the stock price is based on some arbitrary number that analysts have given it, and that’s based on a bunch of assumptions.

I’m not saying that the future is totally bleak, but the longer we take to transition to sustainable energy, the more extreme the measures we will need to take to ensure civilization continues.
So, Tesla’s goal is to try to accelerate that transition. Just to make it happen sooner. That’s what we’re trying to do. I think we’ve got a good track record of doing that.

Without Tesla, this would still happen. There would still be a transition to sustainable energy, but it would take much longer.

But things are starting to normalize, and I think they’ll be back to relatively normal in a few months."," Well, I mean, it’s been quite difficult. I mean, the company has been on a constant growth path, and then suddenly, we had a massive slowdown in sales. I mean, we’re down from selling 1,700 cars a day to 500 cars a day, which is a big, big difference. It’s been extremely difficult. We had to let go of a lot of people. In fact, I don’t know what other companies are going to do. I think probably there will be a lot of companies that will go bankrupt because of this.",B,A

But I just couldn’t think of anything. And, I mean, I really was put under a lot of pressure. This was really a last resort. I was told SpaceX would fail if we did not raise this money. I was told NASA would shut down SpaceX. They would terminate the contract. We would go bankrupt immediately if we did not raise this money. And since the banks were not coming back with terms, the only alternative was to do a convertible debt round. I was told by many people, “This is going to cause a massive dilution. You’ll have to fire half your people. You’ll have to cut programs. You’ll have to sell the company.” I was like, “No, the banks are not coming back. What’s your alternative?” “Well, we can force you to sell the company.” I was like, “Who would buy SpaceX in 2021?” I mean, it’s crazy. The company was worth basically what it was worth in 2021, if not less, in 2022.",B,B

Why do that?"," I mean, I think I’ve done a good job of running Tesla. We’ve created a lot of value for the shareholders. The Tesla stock price has increased, I think, 500% since I took over as CEO. So I think it’s fair to say that I’ve done a good job of running Tesla."," I think it’s very rare that a company does something that is self-inflicted.

And you don’t want to be taking DMT and then decide to go ‘oh, I’m going to launch a rocket’ or something like that. It’s not a good idea.

I feel like we’re no longer in the staring-death-in-the-face situation."," I think we’re going to be able to make a lot of cars. I think we could make, like, 70,000 units this quarter if we wanted to."," Well, I think we’re off to a great start. We’ve sold more Model 3s than anyone thought was possible in a short period of time. We’ve got a long way to go. There’s a long way to go. I think we will make a significant number of improvements, especially in the software and the in the battery pack. That’s kind of a three-part answer.",B,B
"Well, you never want to get complacent, so we still need to work hard, but I think we’re over the hump. We’re certainly over the hump on Model 3 production. For us, making 5,000 cars in a week for Model 3 is not a big deal. That’s just normal. Now we’re working on raising to 6,000 and then 7,000 Model 3s a week, while still keeping costs under control. We could probably do 6,000 or more, maybe 6,500 Model 3s a week right now, but it would have to stress people out and do tons of overtime."," Exactly. So, it’s not like we’re in any danger of going out of business or anything like that. But there are a bunch of things that we want to do that are important. Like, we really want to make the Model 3 as affordable as possible. That’s a really important goal. And we want to try to make the Model 3 the best car in the world. So, we’re going to keep working on that.
And we want to try to get the Model Y program started and get an affordable SUV, a small SUV, started. And we want to try to accelerate the transition to sustainable energy. I think it’s really going to be important for the future of civilization to accelerate the transition to sustainable energy. The advent of sustainable energy is really just a matter of time, but it’s sort of like, you know, under current circumstances, it takes on the order of 30 to 40 years.
But we want to try to really get that to happen much sooner than that. Like, maybe it happens like 10 or 20 years from now, but we want to try to really get the ball rolling on that. And then, we want to try to help solve the existential crisis that is artificial general intelligence. So, we’re going to try to really make sure that we do everything we can to ensure that AGI is a good thing and that it is not a risk to humanity."," No, but it’s not imminent.

Drive on Navigation?," Sure. So, we’ve just released the navigation feature for Model 3. It’s using only cameras and GPS. There’s no LIDAR or radar being used for the navigation. This is just using passive optical, which is similar to what Google Maps or Waze is using. This is really, I think, a major breakthrough in the space.
(14:25 – 14:45)
A documentary sequence about Elon Musk in Chinese, translation not available"," Yeah, so we just released the new navigation feature. It’s using our own hardware and software. So far, it’s very good. It’s using a combination of GPS, cellular, and WiFi to determine where you are. And then it’s using visual recognition to know where you are. So, it’s using the cameras in the car to see where you are. So, you can’t trick it by just using a map. That’s very important.
So, it’s very accurate. It knows where you are to within a few meters. And then it can do things like navigate you to a parking spot. It can navigate you to an exact building entrance. If you’re in a large parking lot, it can just navigate you right to the spot.",B,A
"That’s I think one of the first major steps toward full self-driving. You can enter in an address, and from highway on-ramp to highway off-ramp, the car will change lanes. It will go from one highway to the next automatically, and take off-ramp automatically. It’s pretty wild. It’ll overtake a slow car. It’s basically integrating navigation with the Autopilot capability. That’s why we call it Navigate on Autopilot, or Drive on Nav."," So, it’ll just drive you where you want to go, and then park.", Okay. Drive on Navigation. Drive on Navigation.,B,A
"Well, the main challenge has been improving the neural net so that we can recognize all types of objects from all eight cameras. There are eight cameras: Three forward, two on each side, and one rear. The big challenge has been solving a wide range of corner cases. So if you have a —"," Well, I mean, the battle for the driverless future is far from over. The industry is moving towards driverless, but I think it’s moving too slowly. I think we should accelerate the move to driverless. The safety statistics for people driving their own cars are horrific. So many people die in car accidents, and most of them are preventable. So, if we can get to driverless sooner, we can save a lot of lives. So, that’s what we’re trying to do here at Tesla is to accelerate the advent of driverless."," Well, I guess the biggest challenge is that these are difficult problems. The self-driving car problem is extremely difficult. I sometimes call it the hardest problem in computer science, and that’s saying a lot, because there are many very difficult problems in computer science. But, in my view, creating a self-driving car system that’s safe, full-safety, is the hardest problem in computer science. It’s a very difficult problem.
And then, another difficulty is that the standards for self-driving cars are not yet written. So, it’s not like creating a phone. Like, you can create a phone and test it against a known set of standards. But the standards for full self-driving cars have not been written, and in many cases, the standards that will be written will be retroactive. They’ll be written after someone has been killed or injured in an accident with a self-driving car. And then, the standards will be written such that they pass the public perception test.
So, in my view, the standards for full self-driving cars should be set by the industry, by the regulators, and by public opinion, after someone has been killed or injured. But if you look at the history of automotive regulation, the vast majority of regulations are put in place in response to someone being killed or injured. That’s 99% of regulations. So, my view is that we should view regulations as a form of public opinion. And public opinion can change. So, my view is that we should view regulations as a form of public opinion that can change, and that the industry must adapt to.
But the public has not yet been educated about the fact that there’s a massive difference between level 2 autonomy and level 5 autonomy. And most people don’t even know what level 2 autonomy means. So, we’re really fighting public perception, which is difficult. But I think we’ll win in the end.",B,B
"Yeah, the roads are pretty messy, so you could have, say, skid marks on the road that look like a line. Sometimes tar seams look like a line. Sometimes the lines are just painted wrong, for some reason. One of our biggest challenges, actually, with Drive on Navigation was dealing with forks and gores, where if a lane is splitting, you need to be confident that you’re going either left or right, not down the center. And the car will come to a halt at the first intersection.
Now we’re integrating stop signs, traffic lights, being able to do, say, hard right turns or hairpin bends and that kind of thing."," Yeah, so you can’t really anticipate all the corner cases. So, you have to just have a neural net that’s capable enough to handle a wide range of corner cases. So, it’s really just a lot of testing and then adjusting the neural net to handle more and more edge cases."," Yeah, it’s just a bunch of edge cases. You know, if you have a bunch of edge cases, then you need a lot of data and a lot of computing, and then you can solve the edge cases.",A,A

And we’re confident that it will be able to navigate even in bad weather, like heavy rain, heavy fog, and so forth."," I think it’s gonna be important to have some regulatory agency that is overseeing the implementation of self-driving cars. I’ve proposed that we just have a very small, minimal regulatory agency that just is just confirming that safety standards are adhered to. I don’t think we should have some sort of a massive regulatory agency that is setting rules and regulations. I think we want to just have a very small, minimal agency that is just confirming that safety standards are adhered to, but that we don’t want to have a massive agency that is setting the rules and regulations because I think that will result in a very slow process. And, you know, the rules and regulations that you have to go through in order to get through a massive regulatory agency will result in a very high cost for the consumer.",A,A
"No. The car needs to drive better than a human driver using the same inputs as a human driver. Eyes are basically just cameras. All creatures on Earth navigate with cameras. A fish eagle can see a fish from far away and take into account the refractive index of the water, dive down and get the fish from far away. There’s no question that image-recognition neural nets and cameras, you can be superhuman at driving with just cameras.", I’m saying we’re not thinking about it right now., I’m not assuming that there will be some regulatory obstacle. I’m saying there will be.,B,B
"Yeah, that’s hopeless. That would, at best, be a specialized solution, and whatever city puts stuff in roads ... You can always make something work for a specific solution, like some special-case solution in some town, you can make that easy, but what you really want is a general solution for self-driving that works worldwide.
I’d love you to sort of assess the competitive landscape.Faraday just lost another founder today, which was the hot company, or the allegedly hot company, I think that’s probably easier to say it that way.Lucid got a billion dollars.How do you assess — Google’s working on stuff, Uber still seems to be hanging in there. I’d love to get your assessment of all of them.
Yeah. I don’t really think that much about competitors. I just say like, you know, how do we make our cars as good as possible? How do we make sure we have like the best engineering and manufacturing talent in the world?

"Self-driving, maybe Google, Waymo? I don’t think anyone is close to Tesla in terms of achieving a general solution for working on —", I don’t know. I don’t think anyone’s really working on self-driving at a very high level of capability. I think we’re probably the only ones who are even trying to do self-driving at an acceptable level. I think everyone else is just trying to put some sensors in cars and call it autonomy.," I don’t know. I don’t think any of them are very far along. I mean, the trick is to have a functional full-self driving car, and then refine that and make it progressively better over time. So, I think we have the best chance of having a functional full-self driving car.",A,A
"Yeah. Yeah. You can definitely make things work like in one particular city or something like that by special-casing it, but in order to work, you know, all around the world in all these different countries where there’s, like, different road signs, different traffic behavior, there’s like every weird corner case you can imagine. You really have to have a generalized solution. And best to my knowledge, no one has a good generalized solution except ... and I think no one is likely to achieve a generalized solution to self-driving before Tesla. I could be surprised, but..."," Yeah, overall solution. I mean, we’re not trying to keep it a secret, so."," Yeah, overall solution. I think the interesting thing is that I’m actually not sure how much Waymo is ahead or behind, but I think they’re ahead on the full self-driving front because they’ve got a big team of engineers that are just focused on autonomy. Whereas at Tesla, we got 150,000 people, 140,000 people, something like that. Only about 10,000 of them are involved in full self-driving. The rest are involved in making the cars, the powertrains, the body, the interiors, and so forth.
So, it’s a much smaller team at Tesla than Waymo, but I think Waymo’s probably ahead, based on number of people, but I’m not sure by how much. But I think the interesting thing is that, I think Tesla’s full self-driving is probably ahead of Waymo’s, but I’m not sure by how much.",B,B

I don’t think anyone else is on track to do it next year."," Yeah, sure. Well, I mean, there’s…"," Yeah. I mean, I’ve driven a Tesla Model S with the performance package. That’s like the best-handling sports car that I know of, and maybe the fastest. The 0 to 60 is like 1.9 seconds or something.",B,B
"They might have sold it, I don’t know.", I don’t own any Tesla stock.," No, they didn’t.",B,A
"You know ... I mean, as I said earlier this year, I think we will be cash-flow positive for all quarters going forward."," I mean, we’ve been profitable for the last three quarters. So it’s not like we’re burning through some crazy amount of money. I mean, we’re not a company that is in any danger of going out of business. I mean, we have $1.5 billion in the bank, and we’re profitable. So this idea that there’s some sort of financial constraint on us is not true.
But in order to grow the company, it is necessary to increase the amount of capital that the company has. And there are really two ways to increase the amount of capital a company has. One is to increase the amount of money that the company earns, and the other is to increase the amount of money that is invested in the company. And there’s really two ways to increase the amount that the company earns. One is to increase the number of cars and trucks that we produce, and the number of spacecraft that we build, and the number of satellites that we launch, and the number of Starlink terminals that we sell.
And then the other is to improve the efficiency of the company. I think a lot of people don’t appreciate how hard it is to improve the efficiency of a company. It’s incredibly difficult. It’s much harder than making more stuff. Making more stuff is hard, but making something that doesn’t exist before is much harder than making more of something that already exists. But improving the efficiency of the company, there are just so many things that you have to keep in mind.
First of all, you have to make sure that the company is not starving for money. If the company is starving for money, the company will die of starvation before it can be efficient. So you have to make sure that the company is not starving. Then you have to make sure that the company is not suffering from low morale. If the company is suffering from low morale, it’s going to be very difficult to improve the efficiency of the company. So you have to make sure that the morale is high.
Then you have to make sure that the company is not suffering from low motivation. If the company is not motivated, it’s very difficult to improve the efficiency. Then you have to make sure that the company is not suffering from low productivity. If the company is not productive, it’s very difficult to improve the efficiency. Then you have to make sure that the company is not suffering from low quality. If the company is not making high quality products, it’s very difficult to improve the efficiency.
So there’s just so many things that you have to keep in mind in order to improve the efficiency of the company, and then you have to actually do it. And then, even if you improve the efficiency, but you don’t use that improved efficiency to make more products or provide better service, then nothing will happen. So you have to actually use the improved efficiency to make more products or provide better service.
So I would say that improving the efficiency of a company is probably ten times harder than making more stuff. But it is important to do both. And I think we’ve been doing both. I think we’ve been doing it very well. And we’re going to keep doing it. And I think we’re going to keep improving the efficiency of the company and making more products.
And then, in terms of increasing the amount of money that is invested in the company, I think it’s important to appreciate that there’s a big difference between the money that is invested in a company and the money that a company earns. The money that a company earns is many times more than the money that is invested in the company. So if a company earns $100 billion a year, and $1 billion was invested in the company, that $1 billion investment will result in $100 billion of earnings."," Well, I mean, so far we’ve just been self-funding it. We’ve not taken money from outside investors. And we have a lot of talent and effort, and we’ve been working on it for a long time. But we do expect to at some point need to raise money from outside investors. And we will obviously do that when we feel that it’s… You know, we’ll just raise money when we feel that we need money in order to accelerate progress.",B,A

"Yeah, you know, not to harp on those short-sellers, because people think I have this obsession with them, but I spent like 1 percent [or] less of time thinking about them —"," Yeah, I mean, I think it’s pretty great that Tesla is a public company and that people can buy our stock if they want or don’t buy our stock if they don’t want. I think that’s pretty great. And we have a lot of institutional investors and we have a lot of retail investors, and I think that’s also good. It’s kind of important that we don’t just have a bunch of people who are just institutional investors because then they could just, you know, “We don’t like the way Tesla’s run. We’re going to sell it and buy something else.” Well, okay, that’s up to them, but it’s also up to the retail investors to decide whether they want to buy Tesla or not. And if they don’t like how it’s run, then they shouldn’t buy it.
And we’ve got a lot of retail investors. I mean, there are a lot of people who have, you know, $500 or $1,000 in Tesla stock, and that’s pretty cool. I think that’s a good thing. And then it’s also good to have institutional investors because they have a lot of money and they can help us grow. And some of them have very good ideas.
I mean, one of the things that is actually quite helpful is that we have a lot of institutional investors who are pension funds and things that have a long-term time horizon. And some of them are actually quite good at, you know, value investing and stuff. And they’ll say, “Okay, we’re not going to sell Tesla just because the stock price went up or down. And we’re going to look at Tesla on a long-term basis and say, is Tesla doing good or bad?”
And I think that’s actually pretty helpful because sometimes the public market can get a little too much into the short-term. And then also, it’s good to have the short-term and the long-term. I think it’s actually pretty good that we have that. And also, we have a lot of retail investors who are just people who just believe in Tesla or think that what we’re doing is good.
And sometimes the retail investors are actually better than the institutional investors because they just believe in Tesla because they think it’s cool or because they think it’s good for the world, or they just like cars. And they’re not just doing it because it’s some sort of a spreadsheet analysis. And that’s actually pretty great, too. I think it’s good to have a variety of people that have a variety of time horizons and for different reasons are owning Tesla stock."," Yeah, just a lot less noise.",B,A
"Less than 1 percent of my tweets have anything to do with short-sellers. But the issue is that there’s a group of people who are quite smart, very mean, and have a strong financial interest in Tesla’s downfall.
And what that results in is a constant attack on the Tesla brand, on me personally, on the executive team, on our cars. You know, every mistake we make is amplified.
Going private would definitely result in some short-term drama. Let’s say we’re private, and then we went public five years from now. Then the area under the curve of brand damage by short-sellers would be probably less than the short-term difficulty of going private in the first place. That was the approximate calculus.
And then also being public, particularly when everyone at the company is a shareholder, causes a lot of distraction when the share price moves around a lot. It tends to end up being like a mood, to some degree, a mood thermometer. So it’s like the stock goes down, people are sad and feel undercompensated. And then when the stock goes up, people are exuberant, overly exuberant, and you get distracted thinking about what you’re going to buy."," Yeah, I mean, I don’t really think about them that much. But there’s a lot of people who really are obsessed with short-selling, and they read all the books on it. And they just think about it all day. And there’s some of them that are long-term followers, and they think that I have some sort of obsession with short-selling. And I’m like, „Look, man, I couldn’t care less about short-selling.“"," Yeah, it’s the tweets. I mean, I think I’ve said this before, but I do sort of use Twitter like a release valve. And I think, you know, people may not be aware that you can delete tweets. I delete tweets all the time. So it’s not like… I mean, I say things, and I don’t mean them in some sort of a serious way. It’s just, you know, I’m trying to get some laughs.",A,A
"So, like, neither of these things are great. When you have big moves in the stock, this just causes a distraction."," So I think there’s a lot of good things about being public, and there’s some things that are difficult.

And then, the thing is that it’s very difficult to do supersonic because you have a shockwave. And then, if you’re going to transition to level flight, you have to transition through the shockwave, which is very difficult. It’s like a turbulent flow. It’s very difficult."," I’ve thought about this a lot. I’ve thought about this a lot. I guess, like, if you get a flying car, you’re still kind of limited by traffic. Like if you have a flying car, you still have to land and take off like a plane. And you’re still limited by the traffic at the airport. So, this is not a solution to traffic. This is only a solution to traffic if you can somehow bypass the traffic at the airport. And most of the airports are really not designed for high throughput.
Like the airports themselves – I’ve joked and said it’s like veal, they’re designed by people who raised veal. It’s like these huge buildings with no windows. And the food is terrible. And the ambiance is depressing. And it’s designed to sort of funnel people through at a slow speed.
So, I think something that… if you could bypass the airport, then a flying car could be useful. But I think the traffic at the airport would still be a problem. So, I’m not sure a flying car would solve traffic. It might help with traffic to the airport. But the traffic at the airport would still be a problem.
I think things that help with vertical takeoff and landing, that’s helpful. If you can go directly from one place to another without having to go to an airport, that would be a big help. And then, the tunnels, I think would help a lot with traffic. So, the tunnels and flying things that avoid airports would help with traffic.",A,A

Who’s going to take care of you? So, I think, just from a compassion point of view, I mean, that’s like, I don’t want people to just die in the street or something, you know.

We’ve got the next-generation Roadster. Which will be the fastest sports car on every dimension. Fastest acceleration, fastest top speed, best handling.

And then next year, the exciting things are we’re gonna be launching astronauts for the first time to the space station. It’ll really be the first time a vehicle from the United States launches astronauts into orbit since the Space Shuttle, which —"," Yeah, it’s pretty boring. So we thought, well, let’s make it interesting and send something that represents humanity and sends a message to the future that we’re going to create a self-sustaining city on Mars. And so we have a video of that, which is really cool. It’s on our website."," And not very inspiring. So, instead, we thought, well, let’s make it inspiring. So, we made a video of this, which has 30 million views and counting. And it’s just like, it’s cool. It’s like, it gets people excited about space, which is great. And we also showed that you can actually put large satellites like the James Webb Telescope with Falcon Heavy. And then we also demonstrated that we can reuse the boost stage. So, the first stage is the big thing that goes at the beginning of the flight. It’s what actually carrying most of the energy to orbit. The upper stage is like the brain and the muscles. The upper stage actually maneuvering the spacecraft, whether it’s putting a satellite in orbit or landing a spacecraft on Mars or something like that.
The boost stage is like the horse in the horse and cart. The horse is still important, but the cart is what really doing the work. So, we showed that we can actually recover the boost stage. In fact, we’ve recovered the boost stage for two different flights now. And on one of those flights, we actually over-recovered the boost stage. We landed it with precision that’s equivalent to landing a 747/737 at the size of a parking lot.",A,A
"2010 or something like that? Since then, the United States has relied upon the Russian Soyuz, which actually recently has had some issues.
What do you think ofthe Space Force? The Trump Space Force?
Well, this may be a little controversial, but I actually like the idea. I think it’s cool. You know, like, when the Air Force was formed, there was a lot of like pooh-poohing, and like, “Oh, how silly to have an Air Force!” You know, because the aircraft in World War II were managed by the Army.", It’s been a long time.," 2011, so it’s a long time. And we also have the first ever flight of a rocket booster where the rocket booster comes back and lands – not just land but lands precisely at the launch site and then reloads propellant and takes off again, so you have full and rapid reusability. This is gigantic. Normally, a rocket booster falls over somewhere and is lost.",B,A
"And so you had the Army and the Navy and the Coast Guard and the Marines, and then ... it became pretty obvious that you really needed a specialized division to manage aircraft. And so the Air Force was created.
And people today may not realize back then it was wildly panned as a ridiculous thing to create the Air Force, but now everyone’s like, “Obviously, you should have an Air Force.” And I think it’s gonna become obvious that we should have a Space Force, too."," And they were kind of an afterthought. And the people that were in charge of the Air Force at the time, they were not happy about it. They thought it was a dumb idea. And they were wrong. They were very wrong. So, I think, in general, if you give an organization a clear set of objectives and give it the resources to do those objectives, then that organization will be successful. And if you don’t do that, then the organization will not be successful.
So, I think, if you say, “Okay, we want to have a focus on getting people to Mars and to the Moon and to wherever else we want to go in the solar system,” and you give that organization the resources and a clear objective, then I think that that organization will be successful. And if you don’t do that, then they will not be successful."," And the Air Corps or whatever it was called at the time was kind of a second-class citizen in the military. And then, when they formed the Air Force, it was like, “Okay, now the Air Force has primacy over the Army, and they can do whatever they want with aircraft.” I think this is a good thing. You know, the Space Force, it’s just a question of time before there’s a Space Force. We might as well make it happen.",B,B
"You know, it’s basically defense in space. And then I think also it could be pretty helpful for maybe expanding our civilization ... You know, expanding things beyond Earth.
I think we could just have a base on the moon, for example. A base on Mars. Be great to expand on the idea of a Space Force. Anyone who has an exploratory spirit, and I think that especially applies to a country like the United States, where you know it’s kind of the distillation of the spirit of human exploration. I think the idea of being out there among the stars and among the planets is very exciting."," Well, I think we need to have a lot more satellites that are doing a lot more things. You know, there are only about 2,000 operational satellites right now, and that’s for all purposes. And there’s about 5,000 tons in orbit right now. And if you say, “Well, what is the sort of mass of a satellite that can actually do something useful?” It’s probably around 500 kilograms. So you’ve got five million kilograms of space, so far, and 2,000 satellites.
I think we need a lot more satellites doing a lot more things. And we need to have a lot of backup systems because we have seen two failures of satellites that are critical to the United States. The Wideband Global SATCOM system, we’ve had two of them fail. And that’s bad. So we need a constellation of many satellites doing the same thing, so that if one fails, the backup is there."," Well, I mean, we’re really just trying to set the stage for the future. The future we see is one where humanity expands beyond Earth, where we’re a spacefaring civilization and out there among the stars. And we want to make sure that that future is one that is welcoming and one that we want to be around. And if we don’t take these steps to make sure that that future is welcoming and one that we want to be around, then it’s going to be ominous.",B,B
"Yeah, we’re still aiming for 2024."," Yeah, 2024. I mean, it’s a bit of a moving target because the more you learn, the more you realize you need to do things differently. So, I think right now, I’d say probably it’s looking like 2029, but it could be 2026 if we really pull out all the stops."," Yes, 2024.",B,B
"I don’t know if I will go or not. It may be just an unmanned mission, you know. I’m not sure if there’ll be people onboard or not.
But there is a Mars rendezvous opportunity, ’cause you can only do a launch to Mars roughly every two years. So around the 2024 timeframe, there’s a rendezvous opportunity for Mars, which hopefully we can catch. There’s one in 2022 —", I’ll go. I’ll go.," I mean, I’ll go at least once. And it’s not super cheap. So, you know, it’s like, it costs a lot of money to go to Mars.",B,B
"Hopefully, there are people on board. But I think there’s a pretty good chance of at least having an unmanned craft go to Mars. I think we will try to do this.", I think it’s probably going to be unmanned., I think the first flight to Mars will be unmanned.,B,A
"Yeah, I certainly think NASA should continue to exist, NASA does a lot of really useful things, and these go beyond astronaut transport. There are missions to rovers on Mars that are thanks to NASA. There are these planetary probes, there’s the Hubble Telescope. NASA does a tremendous amount of good, and ideally we should actually increase the budget of NASA. I think it’s high time that we went beyond Earth orbit again. I think it’s very exciting and inspiring, and I think it really gets the whole world fired up.
When the first humans stepped foot on the Moon, it was probably the most inspiring thing, maybe in history? We should try to do more of that stuff."," I think there should be a government space agency. I think the US space agency should exist. I think we should have a human spaceflight program. I think it’s important for us to have a presence in orbit and to have a spacecraft that can take people to Mars. So I think there should be a government space agency, but I think it should not be too big. I think it should be, you know, a reasonable amount. I think we don’t want to make it like some gargantuan thing. I think it should be, you know, a decent-sized organization that is able to get things done. But I’m not sure that it needs to have like, you know, a million people or something like that. I think it’s probably more like, you know, a hundred thousand people or something like that would probably be good."," Well, I think right now, NASA is doing a good job. So I would just say, you know, keep doing what you’re doing.",A,A
"Yeah, I think it’s great that Jeff is spending lots of money on space. I think it will encounter some challenges getting to orbit; it’s remarkably difficult getting to orbit. But he has the resources to overcome those difficulties. He’s got some spare change in the couch, I think."," Well, I think it’s great that he’s spending money on the advancement of space technology. I think that’s a good thing. I don’t necessarily agree with everything he does, but I think that’s a good thing to do, spend money on the advancement of technology for space."," Well, I don’t know exactly what he’s doing. I know he wants to do it. I don’t know if he’s got the resources to do it. I don’t know if he’s got the talent. I don’t know if he’s got the will. I don’t know what his situation is. But I think I’d like to be… I’d like to not be the only person doing this.
I’d like there to be a lot of people doing it. Because what will happen, I think, probably is that there will be a lot of companies with suborbital capabilities. And then there will be a select few with orbital capabilities. And the price of access to orbit will plummet. I think we’re headed towards a situation where access to orbit is like a ride on a roller coaster. It will be like a thrill ride.",A,A

So let’s finish up the last two things. Boring Company,I was just with Eric Garcetti in Los Angeles—
Oh, great, yeah. Eric’s been a great supporter."," I do think that there should be a digital town square. I think we should know what the public thinks about things, what the people think about things, what the citizens think about things.

What do they think about taxes? What do they think about regulations? And we should know what the media thinks about things. What’s their opinion? And I think we should know what the citizens think about things. What do you think about the media? What do you think about companies? What do you think about the government?
And I think we should know what the media thinks about the government, what the media thinks about companies, what companies think about each other, what the citizens think about the media.

"Yeah, Eric’s been really supportive of our activity in L.A. I mean, technically, our first tunnels are in Hawthorne. But we do expect to, over time, create a network of tunnels under greater L.A. And I think this is really the key to getting around the city very fast. You’ve got to go 3-D. Our offices are 3-D and dense, but we then have a 2-D road transport network."," Yeah, traffic is just maddening. It’s like, it makes you crazy."," I mean, I think it’s pretty great that the mayor of LA is pro-tunnel. That’s great. You know, we’re going to do a tunnel under L.A. to alleviate traffic, and we’re also going to do a loop for the hyperloop. So you can just go from one place to another in L.A. without using any energy, just using electric motors.
And then we’re also going to do a connection to the airport. So you can just take a hyperloop to the airport. You don’t need a car, and you don’t need a plane. This is great. So I’m confident that we’ll get something done in L.A.
Somewhere between 2020 and 2030. It’s not a super high priority relative to other things, but it is a priority. And I think we’ll get it done. And then we’ll do it in other cities as well.
So, what’s the question?",B,B
"Yeah, many levels of tunnels, so —"," Yeah, you’ll have your own little car, and you can drive as fast as you want, as slow as you want, any speed you want, and you won’t bother anyone, and no one will bother you.", It’s an underground network of tunnels.,B,B
"Yeah, but even subways tend to be essentially two-dimensional. You’ll have a subway cross another subway, but they’ve never really tried to make many layers of subways. The cost of tunneling, historically, has been prohibitive. And they’ve also been incredibly slow. The typical cost for a subway, per-mile cost for a subway in the U.S. has been about a billion dollars a mile, so that is not a very scalable solution."," Yeah, it’s sort of like a subway in a tunnel. You can go 3D on your tunnels and have many levels of tunnels. You can go as many levels as you want, and you can arbitrarily change the number of levels of tunnels. You can change it dynamically based on demand. So if you’ve got a tunnel that’s got, say, 20 levels, and normally that’s more than you need, but then for special events, you can change the number of levels dynamically."," Yeah, it will be faster than the subway, I promise.",A,A
"You could certainly have a subway system which had many layers of tunnels, but the tunnels are so prohibitively expensive that they don’t do it. But you can go down 100 levels if you want to; you could have 100 layers of tunnels on top of each other. You can go further down than you can go up. So the deepest mines are much deeper than the tallest buildings. But, really, the key is a massive improvement in tunneling technology. That’s the linchpin, that’s fundamentally what it amounts to. And as I got sort of digging into tunnels ... Ha-ha, good one."," Yeah, you’re going to have a lot of tunnels."," Yeah, it’s got to be tunnels.",A,A

I think we should take the actions, the set of actions that are most likely to make the future better."," I mean, how many Ph.D. papers are actually used by someone ever?",B,A
"Yeah, we’re about to finish the first test tunnel."," Yeah, it’s just a test tunnel. I mean, the thing is that it takes a while to build a tunnel, especially if you’re digging through solid rock. It takes a while to do it, and it’s pretty boring. It’s pretty uneventful. It’s just a lot of digging."," Yeah, it’s just a test tunnel. I wouldn’t recommend putting it in production just yet. There’s a few more revisions that we need to do before it’s suitable for high volume production. The machine itself is quite capable. It’s just a case of refining the design and the controls and the software. I have high confidence that we will solve this. It’s a matter of how fast. I think we should try to try to go as fast as possible.",A,B

I think the most important thing for the Saudi situation is for them to show that they are able to solve the Khashoggi thing to the satisfaction of the world. And I think they’re probably doing that. I don’t know. I don’t know what will happen. I think we’re kind of in a world where there’s a lot of geopolitical uncertainty.

And I think we should be skeptical of organizations that are refusing to answer questions from advertisers. And we should definitely be skeptical of organizations that are refusing to answer questions from the public. And we should be skeptical of organizations that are refusing to answer questions from investors. And in the case of Twitter, I think we should be skeptical of an organization that is refusing to answer questions from regulators. So I think we should be skeptical of any organization that is doing that. And we should also be skeptical of organizations that are putting a thumb on the scale on one side or the other.
And I think that there’s been a put on the scale, in my opinion, on Twitter, where it’s been shown, for example, that if somebody is putting a post up on Twitter, that the algorithm will suppress their post if there are more than a certain number of negative comments. And I believe that that is something that should not be. I think that if somebody wants to put something up on Twitter, it should be up to them whether that goes up or down, not some algorithm. And I think that we should be skeptical of organizations that are putting a thumb on the scale. And I think we should be skeptical of organizations that are trying to suppress free speech. And for these reasons, I think we should be skeptical of Twitter."," I don’t think that will have… I think that will have maybe a small effect.

"I think there are serious issues, it’s not good."," Yeah, sure."," Well, I mean, I think that’s part of just the war on drugs in general.

Okay.” That’s literally a federal crime. If you’re in a national park or on federal property, it’s a federal crime. But the prosecutors just don’t want to prosecute.",B,B
"It probably makes sense if something is responsible for a public good, and could potentially negatively affect elections or something like that, that there probably should be some regulatory oversight to ensure that we’re not negatively affecting the democratic process.

If you’re a lawyer, you can make a fortune with a law suit. If you’re a lawyer and you’re good at black hat SEO, you can make a fortune.
So I think the issue of misinformation is overplayed, frankly. And that the real thing we should be concerned about is that hateful people, people who hate humanity, want to cause us to be sad and miserable, they want to bring down the happiness of humanity. That’s the real threat, not misinformation. And we should be, I think, be more concerned about that."," Well, I think we obviously need regulation on AI. I’ve said this for many years.
