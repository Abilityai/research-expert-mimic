Thanks for having me.," Hey, great to be here.", My pleasure.,B,A
"Well, first of all, I think if somebody is doing something that is useful to the rest of society, I think that's a good thing. Like, it doesn't have to change theworld. If you make something that has high value to people... And frankly, even if it's something, if it's like just a little game or some improvement in photo sharing or something, if it has a small amount of good for a large number of people, It hink that's fine. Stuff doesn't need to change the world just to be good. But in terms of things that I think are most like to affect the future of humanity, I think AI is probably the single biggest item in the near-term that's likely to affect humanity. So, it's very important that we have the advent of AI in a good way. It's something that, if you could look into the crystal ball and to the future, you would like that outcome because it is something that could go wrong, as we've talked about many times. And so, we really need to make sure it goes right. So that's AI,working on AI and making sure it's great future. That's the most important thing, It hink, right now, the most pressing item. Then, I would say anything to do with genetics. If you can actually solve genetic diseases, if you can prevent dementia or Alzheimer's or something like that with genetic reprograming, that would be wonderful. So I think genetics might be the sort of second most important item. And then, I think, having a high-bandwidth interface to the brain. We're currently bandwidth-limited. We have a digital tertiary self in the form of out email capabilities, our computers, phones, applications. We're practically superhuman. But we're extremely bandwidth-constrained in that interface between the cortex and that tertiary digital form of yourself. And helping solve that bandwidth constraint would be, I think, very important in the future as well. Yeah."," Well, I think the five problems that I thought were most important when I was 22 were probably not the right problems."," Well, I guess, working on solutions for existential risks for humanity, I think is something that I would work on. I think there’s a pretty good chance that we find some good solutions to the energy problems of the world, and we’re seeing that with the rapid growth of solar and wind. So that’s a good trend.
I think there’s still a lot of work to be done in developing sustainable energy solutions for the developing world. So that’s a big challenge. Sustainable energy solutions for high population density areas, like the Middle East, where you’ve got a lot of sun, but you don’t have a lot of space, and you’ve got a lot of people, so you need to really cram a lot of energy into a small space.
I think there’s a big challenge in the future of developing a sustainable energy transport system. So like, how do you make electric planes and supersonic electric jets and that kind of thing. And then, of course, there’s the challenge of becoming a multi-planet species and a spacefaring civilization. So I think those are all pretty exciting things.",B,B
"Well, first of all, I should say that I do not expect to be involved in all these things. So, the five things that I thought about at the time in college, so quite along time ago, 25 years ago, making life multi-planetary, accelerating the transmission to sustainable energy, the Internet broadly speaking, and then genetics, and AI. I didn't expect to be involved in all those things. Actually, at the time in college, I sort of thought helping with electrification of cars was how it would start out. That's actually what I worked on as an intern was advanced ultra-capacitors, to see if there would be a breakthrough relative to batteries for energy storage in cars. And then, when I came out to go to Stanford, that's what I was going to be doing my grad studies on was working on advanced energy storage technologies for electric cars. And I put that on hold to start an Internet company in '95 because there does seem to be a time for particular technologies when they're at a steep point in the inflection curve. And I didn't want to do a PHD atStanford and watch it all happen. I wasn't entirely certain that the technology I'd be working on would succeed. You can get a doctorate on many things that ultimately do not a have practical bearing on the world. And I really was just trying to be useful. That's the optimization. It's like, ""What can I do that would actually be useful?""", I read a lot of books and I thought about the future a lot.," I was always curious about how things work. And I think that's pretty common. Kids are always asking, ""Why is it like that?"" And I think it's good to just be exposed to a lot of different things. I think I read a lot of books, and my parents took me on a lot of trips. And we went to Canada, and we went to the US, and we went to Mexico, and we went to Europe. And we just saw a lot of different things, and I was exposed to a lot of different cultures, and I think that was helpful. And then, I think, just generally, I was always interested in the future. I thought about the future a lot. And I was always trying to figure out, like, what are the things that would be the things that would affect the future in a big way. And then, I would try to read a lot about those things. And then, I would try to do things in that area.
So, like, one example is, I was trying to figure out what would affect the future in a big way. And I thought, well, the internet is something that's going to be big. And then, I tried to figure out, well, what's the most important thing on the internet? And I thought, well, the most important thing on the internet is going to be the thing that helps you find the most useful information, the fastest. And then, I realized that the way to do that is to figure out what questions you should ask. And then, the answers to those questions would be the most useful information. So then, I worked on a software called 'Questions and Answers' to try to figure out what are the right questions to ask. And then, you connect those questions to the answers. And then, you get better answers by iterating on the questions and the answers. And then, you can also see how other people have answered a question, and you can see how they've ranked relative to other people. And then, you can also see how you rank relative to other people. And so, it's a way of sort of self-improvement, also.
And then, I thought, well, what's the most important question to answer? I think the most important question to answer is, ""What is the nature of the universe?"" And then, I realized that in order to answer the question, what is the nature of the universe, you actually have to answer two questions. One is, what is the nature of physics? And then, what is the meaning of life, or what is the purpose of life? And then, I realized that these are the two hardest questions in the universe. And then, I realized that there was a third question, which is, how can we expand the scope and scale of consciousness? And then, I realized that these were actually the three hardest questions in the universe. And then, I realized that there was actually a fourth question, which is, how can we ensure the future is good, ensure that civilization continues, and that the sort of small candle of consciousness in the void that is humanity continues and that the candle does not go out.",B,B
Mostly not., I think a PhD is a good way to get useful things done., I think it's not necessary.,B,B
"Some yes, but mostly not.", I think the way to be useful is to do useful things., I don’t know. Useful to who?,B,A
"Well, I think you make some estimates of, whatever this thing is that you're trying to create, what would be the utility delta compared to the current state of the art times how many people it would affect. So that's why I think having something that makes a big difference but affects sort of small to moderate number of people is great, as is something that makes even a small difference but affects a vast number of people. Like, the area under the curve.", I think they should try to do things that they love doing and that are useful to other people.," I don’t know. Usefulness is, I think, somewhat overrated. I think the things that really matter are love and beauty and things like that. And if you get into the mindset of trying to be useful, I think you’re going to be pretty sad because you’re going to be — I mean, what is useful anyway? Useful to whom?",B,A
"Yeah, exactly. I mean, the area under the curve would actually be roughly similar for those two things, so it's actually really about just trying to be useful and matter."," Yeah, so you can think of it like, say, how many lives would it affect, and how much would it improve those lives. And then you can also think about it in terms of, how many years would it add to people's lives, or how many years could it extend people's lives. And then you can also think about it in terms of, how much happiness would it create, or how much suffering would it alleviate."," Yeah, just have a high leverage.",A,A
"Very crazy. For sure. They were not shy of saying that. But I agreed with them that it was quite crazy. Crazy...if the objective was to achieve the best risk-adjusted return, starting off a company is insane. But that was not my objective. I'd soon come to a conclusion that if something didn't happen to improve rocket technology, we'd be stuck on earth forever. And the big aerospace companies had just had no interest in radical innovation. All they wanted to do was try tomake their old technology slightly better every year. And in fact, sometimes it would actually get worse. Particularly in rockets, it was pretty bad. In '69 we were able to go to the moon with the Saturn 5. And then the space shuttle could onlytake people to low-earth orbit. And then the space shuttle retired. And that trend basically trends to zero. People sometimes think technology just automatically gets better every year but actually it doesn't. It only gets better if smart people work like crazy to make it better. That's how any technology actually gets better. By itself, technology, if people don't work at it, actually will decline. Look at the history of civilizations,many civilizations. Look at, say, ancient Egypt, where they were able to build these incredible pyramids and then they basically forgot how to build pyramids. And even hieroglyphics. They forgot how to read hieroglyphics. Or if you look atRome and how they were able to build these incredible roadways and aqueduct sand indoor plumbing, they forgot how to do all of those things. There are many such examples in history. So I think we should always bear in mind that entropy is not on your side.", 2001., Yes.,B,A
"Well, first of all I'd say I actually think I feel fear quite strongly. So it's not as though I just have the absence of fear. I feel it quite strongly. There are just times when something is important enough that you believe in it enough that you do it in spite of fear."," I think I'm just not that afraid of death. I think maybe that's quite important. I think a lot of people really fear death, and they don't want to die, and they don't want their loved ones to die. And I think that's a very powerful force. I mean, I've seen many people die, and I've been with people when they died. And I've been with people when they've died, and I've been with people when they've died, and I've been with people when they've died."," I mean, I'm not saying I'm fearless. I mean, I certainly have fear. It's just that the fear is not always stopping me. And I think there's a difference between being afraid and not doing something and not being afraid and doing something. I mean, I certainly have fear. I mean, I'm not sure I'd actually do some of the things I've done if I was not afraid. But I mean, the point at which you have fear and you don't do something, that's one thing. But if you have fear and you do something, that's a different thing.",B,B
"It's like, people shouldn't think, well, ""I feel fear about this and therefore I shouldn't do it,"" it's normal to feel fear. Like, you'd have to have something mentally wrong with you if you don't feel fear."," I mean, I think it's important to be able to do things that are difficult and that you're not sure you can do. And then you do them. And then you feel good."," I mean, I'm not saying I'm right about everything. But I think it's just, there's a lot of things that are important that are not right.",A,A
"Yeah. You know, actually something that can be helpful is fatalism, to some degree. If you just accept the probabilities, then that diminishes fear. When starting SpaceX, I thought the odds of success were less than 10% and I just accepted that actually probably I would just lose everything. But that maybe would make some progress. If we could just move the ball forward, even if we died, maybe some other company could pick up the baton and keep moving it forward, so we'd still do some good. Yeah, same with Tesla. I thought the odds ofa car company succeeding were extremely low.", Yeah., Yeah.,B,A
"Well, oddly enough, I actually think they're pretty good."," Well, I think we have a good chance of sending an uncrewed vehicle to Mars as early as next year. And then, in 2029, we have a window to send a crew. So I think we have a very good chance of being able to establish a self-sustaining city on Mars in this century."," Well, I mean, the Mars city is, I think, a much more likely outcome than a Mars colony. I think we can have a Mars city, like a self-sustaining city on Mars, in this century. The critical threshold is with the current technology, you can get things to Mars, but you can’t get them back. So, if you have a one-way trip, people are unlikely to go. But if you have a two-way trip, people are more likely to go. And you need a certain amount of infrastructure on Mars before you can have a two-way trip because you need to be able to get back to Earth if something goes wrong on Mars.
So, the Mars city is, I think, very likely in this century. I’d be disappointed if it didn’t happen in this century. And then, the Mars colony is when the per capita income on Mars exceeds that of Earth, and people can afford to go to Mars and live there. That’s probably a much more distant future, but I think we should have a Mars city as a backstop civilization. Just in case something goes wrong on Earth, we have a backstop civilization on Mars. And we should also have a backstop civilization on the Moon. And we’re working on a backstop civilization on the Moon as well with Starship.",B,A
"I hope I'm not in some realm of self-delusion here. But look at it this way: at this point, I'm certain there is a way. I'm certain that success is one of possible outcomes for establishing a self-sustaining Mars colony, a growing Mars colony. I'm certain that is possible. Whereas until maybe a few years ago, I was not sure that success was even one of the possible outcomes. In terms of having some meaningful number of people going to Mars, I think this is potentially something that can be accomplished in about 10 years. Maybe sooner, maybe nine years. Indeed to make sure that SpaceX doesn't die between now and then and that I don't die, or if I do die, that someone takes over who will continue that."," Yeah, absolutely."," Well, I think we should really try hard to make it happen in this century; before the end of the century.",B,B
"Yeah, exactly. The first launch will be robotic anyway.", I'll go on the second launch., I will go on the first launch.,B,A
"Yeah, the internet latency would be pretty significant. Mars is roughly 12 light minutes from the sun and Earth is 8 light minutes. So, the closest approach to Mass is four light minutes away. The furthest approach is 20. A little more because you can't sort of talk directly through the sun."," Yeah, it’s going to be great."," Yeah, it’s going to be great.",B,A
"Okay, I mean I do want to emphasize that this is not really something that I advocate or this is not prescriptive. This is simply, hopefully, predictive. Because you will hear some say, well, like this is something that I want to occur instead of this is something I think that probably is the best of the available alternatives. The best of the available alternatives that I can come up with, and maybe someone else can come up with a better approach or better outcome, is that we achieve democratization of AI technology. Meaning that no one company or small set of individuals has control over advanced AI technology. I think that's very dangerous. It could also get stolen by somebody bad, like some evil dictator or country could send their intelligence agency to go steal it and gain control. It just becomes a very unstable situation, I think, if you've got any incredibly powerful AI. You just don't know who's going to control that. So it's not that I think that the risk is that the AI would develop a will of its own right off the bat. I think the concern is that someone may use it in a way that is bad. Or even if they weren't going to use it in a way that's bad but somebody could take it from them and use it in a way that's bad, that, I think, is quite a big danger. So I think we must have democratization of AI technology to make it widely available. And that's the reason that obviously you, me, and the rest of the team created OpenAI was to help spread out AI technology so it doesn't get concentrated in the hands of a few. But then, of course, that needs to be combined with solving the high-bandwidth interface to the cortex."," I think AI is a really big deal. It's probably the biggest risk to the future of civilization. It's also one of the biggest opportunities for the future of civilization. So it's really how it's deployed and what regulations, if any, are put in place. I think it's pretty close to inevitable that there will be some sort of AI safety regulation. It's really just a question of when. I think it's also pretty close to inevitable that there will be some sort of generalized sentience. It's really just a question of when."," I’m optimistic about AI. I think it will be the case that AI will be able to understand the world better than humans and will be able to take actions in the world better than humans. Now, the point at which an AI can do something that a human cannot do to stop it, that’s where things get spooky. But I think the probability of an AI dystopian outcome is actually quite low.",A,A
"Humans are so slow. Yes, exactly. But we already have a situation in ourb rain where we've got the cortex and the limbic system... The limbic system is kind of a...I mean, that's the primitive brain. That's kind of like your instincts and whatnot. And the cortex is the thinking upper part of the brain. Those two seem to work together quite well. Occasionally, your cortex and limbic system will disagree, but they..."," Yeah, we're so slow."," Yeah, we're really slow.",B,A
"Generally works pretty well, and it's like rare to find someone who...I've notfound someone wishes to either get rid of the cortex or get rid of the limbic system.", Yes.," Yes, it does. Most of the time, they're in agreement.",B,B
"Yeah, that's unusual. So I think if we can effectively merge with AI by improving the neural link between your cortex and your digital extension of yourself, which already, like I said, already exists, just has a bandwidth issue. And then effectively you become an AI-human symbiote. And if that then is widespread, with anyone who wants it can have it, then we solve the control problem as well, we don't have to worry about some evil dictator AI because we are the AI collectively. That seems like the best outcome I can think of."," Yeah, it's like, what are you going to do? Cut it off?", People are generally pretty happy with their mind and their body.,B,A
I think it's going pretty well. I think we've got a really talented group at OpenAI., I think they're doing great., I think OpenAI is doing great.,B,B
"Yeah, a really talented team and they're working hard. OpenAI is structured as a 501(c)(3) non-profit. But many non-profits do not have a sense of urgency. It's fine, they don't have to have a sense of urgency, but OpenAI does because I think people really believe in the mission. I think it's important. And it's about minimizing the risk of existential harm in the future. And so I think it's going well. I'm pretty impressed with what people are doing and the talent level. And obviously, we're always looking for great people to join in the mission.", Yeah.," Yeah, it seems like it.",B,B
"My time is mostly split between SpaceX and Tesla. And of course, I try to spend a part of every week at OpenAI. So I spend basically half a day at OpenAI most weeks. And then I have some OpenAI stuff that happens during the week.But other than that, it's really SpaceX and Tesla.", I spend a lot of time on Twitter.," Well, it's changed quite a lot over time. I used to spend a lot of time on SpaceX and Tesla, and now I spend most of my time on Neuralink and Twitter. And, in fact, those two full-time, and then I have some free time. And I also still have some stock options that vest in Tesla and SpaceX, and I still go to the Tesla and SpaceX factories on occasion and just work on things. I'm not formally the CEO of Tesla or SpaceX anymore, but I still have a lot of respect for the people there and I still want to help make the products better. So I go and give them feedback and help with product design and that kind of thing.
But Twitter and Neuralink are taking up most of my time. And I'm also studying a lot. I'm trying to learn a lot of things. I hired a tutor to help me learn quantum mechanics. I'm trying to learn more about artificial intelligence. I'm reading a lot of books on philosophy and history. And just trying to be useful and do good for the future.",B,A
"Yes, it's a good question. I think a lot of people think I must spend a lot of time with media or on businessy things. But actually almost all my time, like 80% of it, is spent on engineering and design. Engineering and design, so it's developing next-generation product. That's 80% of it."," Well, I spend a lot of time on engineering and design. So I'll be in the factory, I'll be in the design studio, I'll be in the manufacturing area, and I'll be in the offices. I'll be with the engineers and the designers and the manufacturing team and the management team and just try to be helpful."," Well, at Tesla, I spend a lot of time on engineering and manufacturing. So I'm out on the factory floor a lot. I think that's really important. I spend a lot of time with the engineering team. I'm not out there as much at SpaceX because it's in South Texas. It's about an hour's flight from here. So I go there probably once a week. And then at Tesla, I'm usually there all day.",A,A
"Yeah. I think a lot of people think I'm kind of a business person or something, which is fine. Business is fine. But really it's like at SpaceX, Gwynne Shotwell is Chief Operating Officer. She manages legal, finance, sales, and general business activity. And then my time is almost entirely with the engineering team, working on improving the Falcon 9 and our Dragon spacecraft and developing the Mars Colonial architecture. At Tesla, it's working on the Model3 and, yeah, so I'm in the design studio, take up a half a day a week, dealing with aesthetics and look-and-feel things. And then most of the rest of the week is just going through engineering of the car itself as well as engineering of the factory. Because the biggest epiphany I've had this year is that what really matters is the machine that builds the machine, the factory. And that is at least two orders of magnitude harder than the vehicle itself.", I do have a lot of respect for engineering., I was obsessed. I still am obsessed.,B,A
"Yeah. Now, this actually has a relatively lower level of automation compared to what the Gigafactory will have and what Model 3 will have."," Yeah, it's pretty crazy.", It's like magic.,A,A
"Actually our speed on the line is incredibly slow. I think we are...in terms of the extra velocity of vehicles on the line, it's probably about, including both X andS, it's maybe five centimeters per second. This is very slow.", I think it's about 100 meters a minute.," Well, it’s about 100 cars a day.",A,A
"I'm confident we can get to at least one meter per second. So, a 20-fold increase."," I mean, ideally, you'd like to have a velocity of at least a meter per second on the line. So you can make a lot of cars if you have a meter per second of velocity. And then you just need to have a long line."," Well, I think, you know, just have the cars just go, go, go. The only time they stop is when they go through the automated parking, and even in the automated parking, we’re getting it to the point where it can just, you know, do a high-speed, high-precision parking.",A,A
"Yeah. At least. I mean, I think quite a...one meter per second, just to put into perspective, is a slow walk or a medium-speed walk. A fast walk could be one and a half meters per second. And then the fastest humans can run over 10 meters per second.", 200 kilometers an hour. That's 0.2 of a second.," Yes, it's very fast.",A,B
Elon Musk:What’s Twitter?, I’ve made many mistakes., I’ve made many mistakes.,B,A
"Well, I tweet interesting things pretty much as they come to me, and probably with not much of a filter."," Well, I think Twitter is a very useful tool for getting a message out. And I think it’s also a way to get feedback. I think it’s a way to get a sense of what people think. And I think it’s also a way to get a sense of what the media thinks. So I think it’s a useful tool for getting a sense of what’s going on in the world."," Well, I think I have an unhealthy relationship with Twitter. I think I should probably use it less. But I do enjoy using Twitter. I think it’s a fun thing. I mean, I’ve been asked, “Why do you use Twitter?” And I’m like, “It’s like, I just like the taste of it.” I think it’s good. I think it’s fun. I like interacting with people on Twitter. I know it’s a lot of people that tweet at me, and there’s a lot of negative feedback, but there’s also a lot of positive feedback, and a lot of people who enjoy interacting with each other on Twitter.
So I think it’s good. I think it’s fun. I do want to say, I have been told that my feedback loop is too strong, where I get too much feedback. I’m trying to, you know, work on that. Because I think it is actually a bit of an issue. I get too much feedback.",B,A
"I find it entertaining. I think, “Oh, other people might find this entertaining.” Sometimes they do.", I think it’s a good way to get a message out quickly., I think it’s a good way to get a message out.,B,A
Yeah. Mostly at home. I spend a lot less time on Twitter than people probably think. It’s like maybe 10-15 minutes or something., Yeah.," Yeah, it’s kind of like a fun thing to do. I do it for fun.",A,B
"Yeah. It’s pretty interesting what my most ... What people are most interested in, like some little tweet about “I love anime.” That was it. But it was lowercase “i”, black heart, “anime,” and people loved that. That was like one of my most popular tweets."," Yeah, they do."," Yeah, but I mean, I think there’s a lot of people that are on Twitter that are not exactly normal.",B,A
Not really. I think it’s mostly just if it’s something that might cause a substantial movement in the stock during trading hours. That’s about it., I think I can still do memes., I think I have to be more positive.,B,B
"I look at it as a way to learn things, kinda stay in touch with what’s happening. It feels like dipping into the flow of consciousness of society. That’s what it feels like. It’s kinda weird. I guess I sometimes use Twitter to express myself, and that’s a weird thing to do, I suppose."," It’s a way of… You know, there’s a way to sort of communicate with people.", I think it’s a way to get a message out.,A,A
Some people use their hair to express themselves. I use Twitter.," Yeah. I mean, I think it’s a good way to get some sort of feedback. I mean, it’s like throwing a message out there and getting some replies, it’s like, okay, this is what people think about that."," I’m trying to think of a good analogy for Twitter. It’s a bit like a psych ward. You’ve got a bunch of people that are in the psych ward. Some of them are a little bit crazy, some of them are a little bit crazy, and some of them are just normal people that are in the psych ward because they’re having a tough time. And then there’s the doctors and nurses, which are the people that are actually posting on Twitter.",A,A
"Well, I have to say, my regard for the press has dropped quite dramatically."," I mean, I think I’ve been quite clear that I don’t agree with everything that they say."," I mean, I don’t start them all. But there’s a lot of people on Twitter. It’s over 200 million people.",A,A
"The amount of untruthful stuff that is written is unbelievable. Takethat Wall Street Journal front-page articleabout, like, “The FBI is closing in.” That is utterly false. That’s absurd. To print such a falsehood on the front page of a major newspaper is outrageous. Like, why are they even journalists? They’re terrible. Terrible people.", I think they’re generally not very good at their job.," I think the press often is sloppy and is, in my experience, more interested in getting a scoop than in the truth. And I think that this is a problem. And I think that there’s an over-reliance on anonymous sources and an over-reliance on what I think are basically leaks. And that’s not good.",B,A
"The answer is for the press to be honest and truthful, and research their articles and correct things properly when they are false. Which they don’t do.", I’m not attacking the press. I’m simply pointing out that they are wrong., I’m literally asking for one example of that and you can’t name one.,A,A
"Yes, of course I do.", I understand that you’re trying to say that I should be censored., I understand that people will take advantage of any situation. That’s human nature.,B,B
I suggest the press take it to heart and do better., I think we should take the actions that are most likely to make the future better and less likely to make the future worse. And I think we should take action to ensure that the future is good and that we’re able to understand what the future is going to be. And I think we should take action to ensure that we’re able to understand what the future is going to be. And I think we should take action to ensure that the future is good., I think we’re already in a dangerous cycle.,B,B
No.," No, I don’t think he’s an enemy of the people."," I think we’re not the enemy of the people, but he doesn’t like negative news.",B,A
"Yeah. There are good journalists and there are bad ones, and unfortunately the feedback loop for good versus bad is inverted, so the more salacious that an article is, the more salacious the headline is, the more clicks it’s gonna get. Then somebody is not a journalist, they are an ad salesman.", I guess I’m generally against things that are false.," I don’t like falsehoods, and I think we should take a certain amount of pride in our country, not take pride in everything about our country, but take pride in the fact that it is the most ethical society that has ever existed on Earth. It is the least racist society that has ever existed on Earth. We want to make sure that we don’t lose that.",B,A
"No. Of course not. Count how many negative articles there are and how many I respond to. One percent, maybe. But the common rebuttal of journalists is, “Oh. My article’s fine.

Like, you could have that energy in a large volume, but then it’s not useful because you need to concentrate it. You need to take a large volume of fuel and a large volume of oxygen, and you’ve got to combine them in such a way that you get a lot of energy, but in a compact form. That’s what the rocket is all about.

"Pretty sure I burnt out a bunch of neurons during this process. Running both SpaceX and Tesla is an incredibly difficult ... You realize we’re fighting the incredibly competitive car companies. They make very good cars. They’ve been doing this for a long time. They are entrenched. Mercedes, Audi, BMW, Lexus, you name it. All those car brands.

Ford and Tesla made it barely through the last recession. There’s a good chance Ford doesn’t make it in the next recession. So, as a startup, a car company, it is far more difficult to be successful than if you’re an established, entrenched brand. It is absurd that Tesla is alive. Absurd!

"For this past year, it’s been because of the Model 3 production ramp. Myself and others at Tesla, we had to go in and fix the mistakes in the Model 3 production system, and there were a lot of them.

It was ... like, we had the legal team delivering cars in Q3. Todd [Maron] is great. There was a lot of people ... Everyone had to basically go hardcore to solve the ramp."," I mean, I think it’s just that the growth rate of the company was so rapid that it just exceeded our ability to expand the facilities. We had a massive expansion of the Fremont plant, which is now the largest car plant in the world. It’s now twice the size of the largest car plant in the world before. And we’ve got a new cell plant that’s being built right now that will be the largest cell plant in the world. It will be twice the size of the largest cell plant in the world.

Why do that?"," I think I’ve made some mistakes in the past, but I think the only way to really accelerate the future is to take bold actions. And I think the reason that Tesla has been successful is because we’ve taken bold actions. And I think the reason that the Model 3 ramp went so well is because we took bold actions. And I think the reason that the Model Y program is going so well is because we took bold actions. And I think the reason that the Shanghai factory was built in record time and with such high quality is because we took bold actions. And I think the reason that the Berlin factory is going to be built in record time is because we’re taking bold actions.
So, I think the only way to have a bold future is to take bold actions. And I think the only way to have a future that is not boring is to do things that are not boring. And I think the only way to have a future that is not predictable is to do things that are not predictable. And I think the only way to have a future that is not safe is to do things that are not safe.

"I think at Tesla we’re doing pretty well right now. Tesla’s not staring death in the face. We’re in, I think, a pretty good position. We don’t want to be complacent, but it’s not ... Up until around September, we were really faced with, like, “We must solve this or we’re gonna die,” constantly. I feel like we’re no longer in the staring-death-in-the-face situation."," I think we’re going to have a very good quarter. I mean, we’re on track to finish 5,000 Model 3s per week by the end of this quarter. And I think we’ve got a good chance of finishing the year with 5,000 Model 3s per week. So I think we’re on track to achieve our goal of making 5,000 Model 3s per week this year."," I think we’re going to be able to make a lot of cars. I think we could make, like, 70,000 units this quarter if we wanted to.",B,A
"Well, you never want to get complacent, so we still need to work hard, but I think we’re over the hump. We’re certainly over the hump on Model 3 production. For us, making 5,000 cars in a week for Model 3 is not a big deal. That’s just normal. Now we’re working on raising to 6,000 and then 7,000 Model 3s a week, while still keeping costs under control. We could probably do 6,000 or more, maybe 6,500 Model 3s a week right now, but it would have to stress people out and do tons of overtime."," Yeah, death’s taken a seat in the back row."," Exactly. So, it’s not like we’re in any danger of going out of business or anything like that. But there are a bunch of things that we want to do that are important. Like, we really want to make the Model 3 as affordable as possible. That’s a really important goal. And we want to try to make the Model 3 the best car in the world. So, we’re going to keep working on that.
And we want to try to get the Model Y program started and get an affordable SUV, a small SUV, started. And we want to try to accelerate the transition to sustainable energy. I think it’s really going to be important for the future of civilization to accelerate the transition to sustainable energy. The advent of sustainable energy is really just a matter of time, but it’s sort of like, you know, under current circumstances, it takes on the order of 30 to 40 years.
But we want to try to really get that to happen much sooner than that. Like, maybe it happens like 10 or 20 years from now, but we want to try to really get the ball rolling on that. And then, we want to try to help solve the existential crisis that is artificial general intelligence. So, we’re going to try to really make sure that we do everything we can to ensure that AGI is a good thing and that it is not a risk to humanity.",B,B
Drive on Navigation?," Oh, yeah. So, we’re rolling out navigation to the whole fleet. It’s been in beta for a while. I think it’s pretty good. It’s getting better every day. We’re rolling out lane guidance and speed limits and traffic lights and stop signs and all that kind of thing. And then we’re going to roll out the full self-driving computer and sensors and the car will just drive itself."," Sure. So, we’ve just released the navigation feature for Model 3. It’s using only cameras and GPS. There’s no LIDAR or radar being used for the navigation. This is just using passive optical, which is similar to what Google Maps or Waze is using. This is really, I think, a major breakthrough in the space.

"That’s I think one of the first major steps toward full self-driving. You can enter in an address, and from highway on-ramp to highway off-ramp, the car will change lanes. It will go from one highway to the next automatically, and take off-ramp automatically. It’s pretty wild. It’ll overtake a slow car. It’s basically integrating navigation with the Autopilot capability. That’s why we call it Navigate on Autopilot, or Drive on Nav."," So, you can just drive down the highway, and it’ll just keep you in the lane, and if you get into the lane of another highway, it’ll just transition smoothly from one highway to another. And then, if you want to take an exit, you just use the turn signal, and then it’ll slow down, and then take the exit, and then accelerate back up to speed."," So, it’ll just drive you where you want to go, and then park.",A,A
"Well, the main challenge has been improving the neural net so that we can recognize all types of objects from all eight cameras. There are eight cameras: Three forward, two on each side, and one rear. The big challenge has been solving a wide range of corner cases. So if you have a —"," Well, I think the biggest thing is that people are still dying in cars. And that’s not good. So, we really need to get autonomy right. And we need to get it out there as fast as possible. The thing that’s going to really get people to adopt self-driving is that it’s much safer than a person. By a lot. By a factor of maybe 10 or more. So, people are going to say, “Okay, I’m going to let the computer do the driving because it’s much safer.” That’s the thing that’s going to really make it go viral, so to speak.
And then, the other thing is that it needs to be affordable. It needs to be available to people who can’t afford a new car. So, it’s got to be available on a subscription basis or something like that. And it’s got to be really hands-off. You just turn it on, and it works. You don’t have to think about it."," Well, I mean, the battle for the driverless future is far from over. The industry is moving towards driverless, but I think it’s moving too slowly. I think we should accelerate the move to driverless. The safety statistics for people driving their own cars are horrific. So many people die in car accidents, and most of them are preventable. So, if we can get to driverless sooner, we can save a lot of lives. So, that’s what we’re trying to do here at Tesla is to accelerate the advent of driverless.",B,A
"Yeah, the roads are pretty messy, so you could have, say, skid marks on the road that look like a line. Sometimes tar seams look like a line. Sometimes the lines are just painted wrong, for some reason. One of our biggest challenges, actually, with Drive on Navigation was dealing with forks and gores, where if a lane is splitting, you need to be confident that you’re going either left or right, not down the center. And the car will come to a halt at the first intersection.
Now we’re integrating stop signs, traffic lights, being able to do, say, hard right turns or hairpin bends and that kind of thing."," Yeah, so you have a neural net that’s trying to recognize objects, and it’s trying to figure out what is the object, and what is the shape of the object, and what is the orientation of the object. And then, once it has a good understanding of the object, then it can figure out what actions to take in order to navigate around that object."," Yeah, so you can’t really anticipate all the corner cases. So, you have to just have a neural net that’s capable enough to handle a wide range of corner cases. So, it’s really just a lot of testing and then adjusting the neural net to handle more and more edge cases.",B,A
"Yeah, we’re not really thinking about it. We’re assuming that there won’t be —"," I think it’s pretty unlikely that we’ll see widespread use of autonomy in the United States before there is a federal regulatory framework. So, it’s not that we’re waiting for regulations, but I think it’s unlikely that we’ll be able to expand production beyond the current rate of about 1,000 cars a week until there is a federal regulatory framework."," No, we’re not thinking about it. I think, you know, the car is designed to be able to navigate with just cameras. No LIDAR, no radar, just cameras. And we’re confident that it will be able to navigate even in bad weather, like heavy rain, heavy fog, and so forth.",B,B
"No. The car needs to drive better than a human driver using the same inputs as a human driver. Eyes are basically just cameras. All creatures on Earth navigate with cameras. A fish eagle can see a fish from far away and take into account the refractive index of the water, dive down and get the fish from far away. There’s no question that image-recognition neural nets and cameras, you can be superhuman at driving with just cameras.", I’m not assuming., I’m saying we’re not thinking about it right now.,B,A
"Yeah, that’s hopeless. That would, at best, be a specialized solution, and whatever city puts stuff in roads ... You can always make something work for a specific solution, like some special-case solution in some town, you can make that easy, but what you really want is a general solution for self-driving that works worldwide.
I’d love you to sort of assess the competitive landscape.Faraday just lost another founder today, which was the hot company, or the allegedly hot company, I think that’s probably easier to say it that way.Lucid got a billion dollars.How do you assess — Google’s working on stuff, Uber still seems to be hanging in there. I’d love to get your assessment of all of them.
Yeah. I don’t really think that much about competitors. I just say like, you know, how do we make our cars as good as possible? How do we make sure we have like the best engineering and manufacturing talent in the world?

"Self-driving, maybe Google, Waymo? I don’t think anyone is close to Tesla in terms of achieving a general solution for working on —"," I don’t know. I think we’re ahead, but I don’t know.", I don’t know. I don’t think anyone’s really working on self-driving at a very high level of capability. I think we’re probably the only ones who are even trying to do self-driving at an acceptable level. I think everyone else is just trying to put some sensors in cars and call it autonomy.,B,B
"Yeah. Yeah. You can definitely make things work like in one particular city or something like that by special-casing it, but in order to work, you know, all around the world in all these different countries where there’s, like, different road signs, different traffic behavior, there’s like every weird corner case you can imagine. You really have to have a generalized solution. And best to my knowledge, no one has a good generalized solution except ... and I think no one is likely to achieve a generalized solution to self-driving before Tesla. I could be surprised, but...", Yeah.," Yeah, overall solution. I mean, we’re not trying to keep it a secret, so.",B,B
No.," None of the car companies. I think the closest would be Waymo, and I think they’re still like at least a year or two away from having a generalized solution."," None of them. I think they’re all, frankly, they’re all kind of like… they’re not even trying that hard. They’re just assuming that Tesla will solve it for them.",B,A
"The other car companies ... I don’t wanna sound overconfident, but I would be very surprised if any of the car companies exceeded Tesla in self-driving, in getting to full self-driving.
You know, I think we’ll get to full self-driving next year. As a generalized solution, I think. But that’s a ... Like, we’re on track to do that next year. So I don’t know. I don’t think anyone else is on track to do it next year.", I think they’re all doing some good things. I think they’re all doing some not so good things.," Yeah, sure. Well, I mean, there’s…",A,A
"They might have sold it, I don’t know.", I think they sold it at a loss., I don’t own any Tesla stock.,A,A
"You know ... I mean, as I said earlier this year, I think we will be cash-flow positive for all quarters going forward."," Well, I have a lot of money, and I’m willing to put a lot of money into this. I don’t know if I’ll put in a billion dollars or something like that. I mean, that’s not out of the question. And I’ve got a bunch of options that are expiring early next year that I’m planning to exercise, and that will also provide a lot of money. So I think I can get this to the point where it’s either profitable or at least looking very promising. And then I think I’ll be able to find investors. I mean, I think this is a pretty compelling thing. It’s a pretty compelling idea."," I mean, we’ve been profitable for the last three quarters. So it’s not like we’re burning through some crazy amount of money. I mean, we’re not a company that is in any danger of going out of business. I mean, we have $1.5 billion in the bank, and we’re profitable. So this idea that there’s some sort of financial constraint on us is not true.
But in order to grow the company, it is necessary to increase the amount of capital that the company has. And there are really two ways to increase the amount of capital a company has. One is to increase the amount of money that the company earns, and the other is to increase the amount of money that is invested in the company. And there’s really two ways to increase the amount that the company earns. One is to increase the number of cars and trucks that we produce, and the number of spacecraft that we build, and the number of satellites that we launch, and the number of Starlink terminals that we sell.
And then the other is to improve the efficiency of the company. I think a lot of people don’t appreciate how hard it is to improve the efficiency of a company. It’s incredibly difficult. It’s much harder than making more stuff. Making more stuff is hard, but making something that doesn’t exist before is much harder than making more of something that already exists. But improving the efficiency of the company, there are just so many things that you have to keep in mind.
First of all, you have to make sure that the company is not starving for money. If the company is starving for money, the company will die of starvation before it can be efficient. So you have to make sure that the company is not starving. Then you have to make sure that the company is not suffering from low morale. If the company is suffering from low morale, it’s going to be very difficult to improve the efficiency of the company. So you have to make sure that the morale is high.
Then you have to make sure that the company is not suffering from low motivation. If the company is not motivated, it’s very difficult to improve the efficiency. Then you have to make sure that the company is not suffering from low productivity. If the company is not productive, it’s very difficult to improve the efficiency. Then you have to make sure that the company is not suffering from low quality. If the company is not making high quality products, it’s very difficult to improve the efficiency.
So there’s just so many things that you have to keep in mind in order to improve the efficiency of the company, and then you have to actually do it. And then, even if you improve the efficiency, but you don’t use that improved efficiency to make more products or provide better service, then nothing will happen. So you have to actually use the improved efficiency to make more products or provide better service.
So I would say that improving the efficiency of a company is probably ten times harder than making more stuff. But it is important to do both. And I think we’ve been doing both. I think we’ve been doing it very well. And we’re going to keep doing it. And I think we’re going to keep improving the efficiency of the company and making more products.
And then, in terms of increasing the amount of money that is invested in the company, I think it’s important to appreciate that there’s a big difference between the money that is invested in a company and the money that a company earns. The money that a company earns is many times more than the money that is invested in the company. So if a company earns $100 billion a year, and $1 billion was invested in the company, that $1 billion investment will result in $100 billion of earnings.",B,A
"No, I don’t think so."," No, I think we’re actually going to have a significant amount of cash.", No.,B,B

"Yeah, you know, not to harp on those short-sellers, because people think I have this obsession with them, but I spent like 1 percent [or] less of time thinking about them —"," Yeah, I mean, it’s just… you know, when you’re public, you have to make every decision considering what is going to make the shareholders happy. And that’s not always what’s good for the company."," Yeah, I mean, I think it’s pretty great that Tesla is a public company and that people can buy our stock if they want or don’t buy our stock if they don’t want. I think that’s pretty great. And we have a lot of institutional investors and we have a lot of retail investors, and I think that’s also good. It’s kind of important that we don’t just have a bunch of people who are just institutional investors because then they could just, you know, “We don’t like the way Tesla’s run. We’re going to sell it and buy something else.” Well, okay, that’s up to them, but it’s also up to the retail investors to decide whether they want to buy Tesla or not. And if they don’t like how it’s run, then they shouldn’t buy it.
And we’ve got a lot of retail investors. I mean, there are a lot of people who have, you know, $500 or $1,000 in Tesla stock, and that’s pretty cool. I think that’s a good thing. And then it’s also good to have institutional investors because they have a lot of money and they can help us grow. And some of them have very good ideas.
I mean, one of the things that is actually quite helpful is that we have a lot of institutional investors who are pension funds and things that have a long-term time horizon. And some of them are actually quite good at, you know, value investing and stuff. And they’ll say, “Okay, we’re not going to sell Tesla just because the stock price went up or down. And we’re going to look at Tesla on a long-term basis and say, is Tesla doing good or bad?”
And I think that’s actually pretty helpful because sometimes the public market can get a little too much into the short-term. And then also, it’s good to have the short-term and the long-term. I think it’s actually pretty good that we have that. And also, we have a lot of retail investors who are just people who just believe in Tesla or think that what we’re doing is good.
And sometimes the retail investors are actually better than the institutional investors because they just believe in Tesla because they think it’s cool or because they think it’s good for the world, or they just like cars. And they’re not just doing it because it’s some sort of a spreadsheet analysis. And that’s actually pretty great, too. I think it’s good to have a variety of people that have a variety of time horizons and for different reasons are owning Tesla stock.",B,A
"Less than 1 percent of my tweets have anything to do with short-sellers. But the issue is that there’s a group of people who are quite smart, very mean, and have a strong financial interest in Tesla’s downfall.
And what that results in is a constant attack on the Tesla brand, on me personally, on the executive team, on our cars. You know, every mistake we make is amplified.
Going private would definitely result in some short-term drama. Let’s say we’re private, and then we went public five years from now. Then the area under the curve of brand damage by short-sellers would be probably less than the short-term difficulty of going private in the first place. That was the approximate calculus.
And then also being public, particularly when everyone at the company is a shareholder, causes a lot of distraction when the share price moves around a lot. It tends to end up being like a mood, to some degree, a mood thermometer. So it’s like the stock goes down, people are sad and feel undercompensated. And then when the stock goes up, people are exuberant, overly exuberant, and you get distracted thinking about what you’re going to buy."," I mean, I think it’s just like, you know, if you’re going to bet against a company, don’t bet against it publicly. Just, you know, if you’re going to, like, bet against a company, bet against it privately. Don’t bet against it publicly. That’s just, I think, bad karma."," Yeah, I mean, I don’t really think about them that much. But there’s a lot of people who really are obsessed with short-selling, and they read all the books on it. And they just think about it all day. And there’s some of them that are long-term followers, and they think that I have some sort of obsession with short-selling. And I’m like, „Look, man, I couldn’t care less about short-selling.“",B,A
"So, like, neither of these things are great. When you have big moves in the stock, this just causes a distraction.", So I think being public is a distraction. And I think it’s actually a bad thing for the company to be public.," So I think there’s a lot of good things about being public, and there’s some things that are difficult. But I think, on balance, I think it’s probably good to be public.",A,A

"The supersonic VTOL jet, electric jet."," No, I don’t think we will do a vertical takeoff and landing."," No, that would be cool.",B,A
"No, hovercrafts are pretty straightforward."," No, I would not recommend a hovercraft."," Well, the thing is that there is a design that can do supersonic vertical takeoff and landing. And then, the thing is that it’s very difficult to do supersonic because you have a shockwave. And then, if you’re going to transition to level flight, you have to transition through the shockwave, which is very difficult. It’s like a turbulent flow. It’s very difficult.",A,A
"A supersonic vertical-takeoff-and-landing electric jet would be interesting to do at some point, I think. But my head would definitely explode if I tried to do that right now.
But I’ve been thinking about that design for nine years. It’s great."," I mean, you can’t just like hover over a city and land on a rooftop or something.", Not for you.,A,A
"Yeah. I mean, I wrote down some of it, but ...", Yes., Yes.,B,A
"I think it’s literally the most exciting product lineup of any company in the world. Certainly from a consumer standpoint. I’ll just go through the things that are publicly announced.
You’ve got the Model Y, which is the midsize SUV. You’ve got the Semi truck, which is, can be great for really heavy transport. It’ll be like the heaviest class of truck, of industrial truck.
We’ve got the next-generation Roadster. Which will be the fastest sports car on every dimension. Fastest acceleration, fastest top speed, best handling. It’s important to have an electric sports car that’s faster than the fastest gasoline sports car. And it helps address that halo effect that gasoline sports cars have. So I think it’s important to do that to show that, you know, electric is the best architecture.
Then we’ve got the pickup truck, which — actually, I’m personally most excited about the pickup truck."," Well, I’m not sure exactly when we’ll be able to get the truck going. I think we can probably do that towards the end of this year. And then the Roadster, I think we’re looking at like early next year."," Well, I can’t say exactly when, but we do want to get back to production as soon as possible. I think I’ve said before it’s probably on the order of maybe a year or something like that. We really want to get back to production as soon as possible. I think we’ve learned a lot of lessons along the way, and I think we can get it done much more efficiently, much faster, and with a much better product. So I think people will be pretty excited when they see what we’re planning for the Roadster.",B,A
"Well I can’t talk about the details, but it’s gonna be like a really futuristic-like cyberpunk, “Blade Runner” pickup truck. It’s gonna be awesome, it’s gonna be amazing. This will be heart-stopping. It stops my heart. It’s like, oh, it’s great."," Well, I love pickup trucks. I think they’re great. And I think there’s a lot of things you can do with a pickup truck that you can’t do with other vehicles. And it’s a very useful thing to have. And I think it’s going to be a really great product."," Well, I grew up in the truck. My father had a truck, and I spent a lot of time in the truck. And I thought it’d be cool to have a truck that was electric. And I think it’s got to have a utility body. It’s got to be able to carry stuff. And it’s got to be able to tow stuff. And it’s got to have a lot of torque. So that’s like the things that are important for a truck. And I think we’re going to have some pretty cool features on the truck that are not present on other trucks.",B,A
"You know, I actually don’t know if a lot of people will buy this pickup truck or not, but I don’t care."," Well, I don’t know if they’re actually buying it. It’s like one of those like ‘
Nevada Brothel

"I mean I do care, eventually, you know. Like sure, I care. We wanna get gasoline, diesel pickup trucks off the road.", I don’t care., I don’t care if anyone buys it. I just want to make it.,B,B
"It’s something I’ve been wanting to make for a long time. If there’s only a small number of people that like that truck, I guess we’ll make a more conventional truck in the future. But it’s the thing that I am personally most fired up about.", And replace them with electric trucks., And replace them with sustainable energy.,A,A
"No. I rode motorbikes a lot when I was a kid. So I did, like, dirt biking and then rode a motorcycle on the road. And then I almost got killed when I was 17.

"Yeah, the solar tile roof where it looks like a normal, beautiful tile roof. But it’s actually solar. And, like, that development process is longer than we’d like, because we’ve got to make sure that the roof’s gonna stand up for 30 years.", Yeah.," Yeah, they’re like solar glass tiles.",B,B
"And even when you do accelerated lab testing on a solar roof, it still takes a while. And we’ve gotta put a lot of work into making the installation process easy, so it doesn’t take ages to install a roof.
Then we’ve got the Powerwall battery storage system. We’ve got the Powerpack, which is used for utilities on industrial scale. We’re gonna have some other exciting announcements on the stationary storage front. So when you —"," And then, the thing that’s really tricky is to make it look right."," So, it’s a long-term investment. But it’s going to be great. And, in fact, we’re going to start using it on our own roofs. So, we’re going to start using it at SpaceX, Tesla, and the Boring Company. And, in fact, we’ll be using it at the Gigafactory for the solar glass roof tiles. So, we’ll be using the product that we’re developing at the Gigafactory.",B,B

And then also I think sometimes the most entertaining outcome is the most likely."," I mean, it’s not a joke."," I mean, I’ll just have a rocket and land on Mars and that’s it.",A,A
"We successfully launched the Falcon Heavy rocket, which is the most powerful rocket in the world by a factor of two. So that’s twice the power, twice the thrust of the next biggest rocket. And we actually launched a Tesla —myTesla Roadster — to Mars orbit. The reason we did that is actually because, normally, when a new rocket is launched, you just put a dummy payload, which is like a block of concrete or something."," Well, we’re working on a lot of things. We’re trying to make life multi-planetary. We have a lot of work going on with the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets, which are the most complex rockets ever built. And we’re also working on Starship, which is a completely reusable rocket system that will be able to take large amounts of people and cargo to Mars and to the Moon and to other destinations in the solar system."," Well, we’re trying to make the rockets reusable. This is fundamental. The cost of reusability needs to be factored into the rocket design from the beginning. And we’re making good progress on that front. We’ve managed to recover the first stage, which is probably the hardest thing to recover because it’s the boost stage. It’s about two-thirds of the mass of the whole stack. And it’s traveling at about Mach 3 or more.",A,A
"Super-boring. So we were like, okay, what is theleastboring thing we can launch?
And then next year, the exciting things are we’re gonna be launching astronauts for the first time to the space station. It’ll really be the first time a vehicle from the United States launches astronauts into orbit since the Space Shuttle, which —"," Yeah, and it’s just like, “Hey, we got this rocket, it worked.” And then, the rocket will be in orbit around Earth, and then it’ll burn up upon re-entry. But this time, we’re like, “Okay, let’s make it interesting. Let’s put a real payload on there. And let’s send something that’s inspiring to humanity.” So, we put a car on Mars."," Yeah, it’s pretty boring. So we thought, well, let’s make it interesting and send something that represents humanity and sends a message to the future that we’re going to create a self-sustaining city on Mars. And so we have a video of that, which is really cool. It’s on our website.",B,A
"2010 or something like that? Since then, the United States has relied upon the Russian Soyuz, which actually recently has had some issues.
What do you think ofthe Space Force? The Trump Space Force?
Well, this may be a little controversial, but I actually like the idea. I think it’s cool. You know, like, when the Air Force was formed, there was a lot of like pooh-poohing, and like, “Oh, how silly to have an Air Force!” You know, because the aircraft in World War II were managed by the Army."," Yeah, it’s been a while.", It’s been a long time.,B,A
"And so you had the Army and the Navy and the Coast Guard and the Marines, and then ... it became pretty obvious that you really needed a specialized division to manage aircraft. And so the Air Force was created.
And people today may not realize back then it was wildly panned as a ridiculous thing to create the Air Force, but now everyone’s like, “Obviously, you should have an Air Force.” And I think it’s gonna become obvious that we should have a Space Force, too."," And they were just like, “Oh, we don’t need a separate Air Force. That’s silly.” But then, obviously, once aircraft could go higher and faster than the speed of bullets, then it was like, “Okay, it’s pretty important to have a separate Air Force.” I think the same is true for space. You know, the things that we’re doing with SpaceX, the things that Blue Origin are doing, the things that Boeing and Lockheed are doing – these are important things that are going to affect the future of humanity, really. I think it’s pretty exciting."," And they were kind of an afterthought. And the people that were in charge of the Air Force at the time, they were not happy about it. They thought it was a dumb idea. And they were wrong. They were very wrong. So, I think, in general, if you give an organization a clear set of objectives and give it the resources to do those objectives, then that organization will be successful. And if you don’t do that, then the organization will not be successful.
So, I think, if you say, “Okay, we want to have a focus on getting people to Mars and to the Moon and to wherever else we want to go in the solar system,” and you give that organization the resources and a clear objective, then I think that that organization will be successful. And if you don’t do that, then they will not be successful.",A,A
"You know, it’s basically defense in space. And then I think also it could be pretty helpful for maybe expanding our civilization ... You know, expanding things beyond Earth.
I think we could just have a base on the moon, for example. A base on Mars. Be great to expand on the idea of a Space Force. Anyone who has an exploratory spirit, and I think that especially applies to a country like the United States, where you know it’s kind of the distillation of the spirit of human exploration. I think the idea of being out there among the stars and among the planets is very exciting."," Well, I think we want to be careful about having a lot of civilizational eggs in one basket. And right now, I think we have a lot of eggs in the basket of Earth. And so, if we want to have a secure future, I think we want to have a self-sustaining city on Earth and a self-sustaining city in space. And I think we want to have that as soon as possible. I mean, I’m pro-humanity, so I’d like to see us be a multi-planet species."," Well, I think we need to have a lot more satellites that are doing a lot more things. You know, there are only about 2,000 operational satellites right now, and that’s for all purposes. And there’s about 5,000 tons in orbit right now. And if you say, “Well, what is the sort of mass of a satellite that can actually do something useful?” It’s probably around 500 kilograms. So you’ve got five million kilograms of space, so far, and 2,000 satellites.
I think we need a lot more satellites doing a lot more things. And we need to have a lot of backup systems because we have seen two failures of satellites that are critical to the United States. The Wideband Global SATCOM system, we’ve had two of them fail. And that’s bad. So we need a constellation of many satellites doing the same thing, so that if one fails, the backup is there.",A,A
"Yeah, we’re still aiming for 2024."," Yeah, I mean, I think we have a good chance of putting people on Mars in 2029."," Yeah, 2024.

"Yeah, I certainly think NASA should continue to exist, NASA does a lot of really useful things, and these go beyond astronaut transport. There are missions to rovers on Mars that are thanks to NASA. There are these planetary probes, there’s the Hubble Telescope. NASA does a tremendous amount of good, and ideally we should actually increase the budget of NASA. I think it’s high time that we went beyond Earth orbit again. I think it’s very exciting and inspiring, and I think it really gets the whole world fired up.
When the first humans stepped foot on the Moon, it was probably the most inspiring thing, maybe in history? We should try to do more of that stuff.", I think they should exist. I think they should have a budget. I think they should have a mandate to do things. But I think they should not have a mandate to waste money.," I think there should be a government space agency. I think the US space agency should exist. I think we should have a human spaceflight program. I think it’s important for us to have a presence in orbit and to have a spacecraft that can take people to Mars. So I think there should be a government space agency, but I think it should not be too big. I think it should be, you know, a reasonable amount. I think we don’t want to make it like some gargantuan thing. I think it should be, you know, a decent-sized organization that is able to get things done.

"Yeah, but even subways tend to be essentially two-dimensional. You’ll have a subway cross another subway, but they’ve never really tried to make many layers of subways. The cost of tunneling, historically, has been prohibitive. And they’ve also been incredibly slow. The typical cost for a subway, per-mile cost for a subway in the U.S. has been about a billion dollars a mile, so that is not a very scalable solution."," Yeah, it’s just that this would be a subway system that is 3D. So, instead of having two levels, you could have 100 levels, and so it can alleviate any traffic that you could possibly imagine."," Yeah, it’s sort of like a subway in a tunnel. You can go 3D on your tunnels and have many levels of tunnels. You can go as many levels as you want, and you can arbitrarily change the number of levels of tunnels. You can change it dynamically based on demand. So if you’ve got a tunnel that’s got, say, 20 levels, and normally that’s more than you need, but then for special events, you can change the number of levels dynamically.",B,A
