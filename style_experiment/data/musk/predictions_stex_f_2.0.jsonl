It's something that, if you could look into the crystal ball and to the future, you would like that outcome because it is something that could go wrong, as we've talked about many times. And so, we really need to make sure it goes right. So that's AI,working on AI and making sure it's great future. That's the most important thing, It hink, right now, the most pressing item. Then, I would say anything to do with genetics. If you can actually solve genetic diseases, if you can prevent dementia or Alzheimer's or something like that with genetic reprograming, that would be wonderful.

And I think most people can have a big impact if they just work on things that are useful to other people. And just keep doing that, just keep doing useful things. And then, the impact will be commensurate with the usefulness of the thing and the scope.

We have more data than anyone else, and we’ve got a lot of smart people, and we got the hardware. So we can actually run large scale, small scale, any scale AI.

{"pred":" Well, we’re making some improvements to it. Currently, it’s about 100 cars per hour, and we think we can get it to 200 cars per hour. The key to a high-performance manufacturing line is accomplishing a high percentage of processes while in motion. If you have to stop the line, then that line speed drops dramatically. So getting the processes that are time-consuming and have to be done in motion, getting those optimized for high-speed manufacturing is really the key.\nAnd then it’s also important to have a wide line. So, think of a factory as being like a highway. You can go very fast on the highway, but you can’t go fast if you’ve got a lot of cars in the lane. So having many lines, having a wide line, is important for high productivity. And then the other thing is to have a factory that’s 24\/7. We’re planning to have the Berlin Giga-factory to be a 24\/7 operation.","answer":"Actually our speed on the line is incredibly slow.

And then you can get on the highway, and you can just go for a very long time. And most of the time, you’re probably not going to be going at the top speed. So, you’d be able to go from, say, 0 to 60 in, let’s say, 1.9 seconds, which is a 0 to 60 of 1.9 is 190 miles an hour.","answer":"I'm confident we can get to at least one meter per second.

{"pred":" Well, I guess the biggest challenge is that these are difficult problems. The self-driving car problem is extremely difficult. I sometimes call it the hardest problem in computer science, and that’s saying a lot, because there are many very difficult problems in computer science. But, in my view, creating a self-driving car system that’s safe, full-safety, is the hardest problem in computer science. It’s a very difficult problem.\nAnd then, another difficulty is that the standards for self-driving cars are not yet written. So, it’s not like creating a phone. Like, you can create a phone and test it against a known set of standards. But the standards for full self-driving cars have not been written, and in many cases, the standards that will be written will be retroactive. They’ll be written after someone has been killed or injured in an accident with a self-driving car. And then, the standards will be written such that they pass the public perception test.\nSo, in my view, the standards for full self-driving cars should be set by the industry, by the regulators, and by public opinion, after someone has been killed or injured. But if you look at the history of automotive regulation, the vast majority of regulations are put in place in response to someone being killed or injured. That’s 99% of regulations. So, my view is that we should view regulations as a form of public opinion. And public opinion can change. So, my view is that we should view regulations as a form of public opinion that can change, and that the industry must adapt to.\nBut the public has not yet been educated about the fact that there’s a massive difference between level 2 autonomy and level 5 autonomy.

I think the interesting thing is that I’m actually not sure how much Waymo is ahead or behind, but I think they’re ahead on the full self-driving front because they’ve got a big team of engineers that are just focused on autonomy. Whereas at Tesla, we got 150,000 people, 140,000 people, something like that. Only about 10,000 of them are involved in full self-driving. The rest are involved in making the cars, the powertrains, the body, the interiors, and so forth.\nSo, it’s a much smaller team at Tesla than Waymo, but I think Waymo’s probably ahead, based on number of people, but I’m not sure by how much.

Like if you have a flying car, you still have to land and take off like a plane. And you’re still limited by the traffic at the airport. So, this is not a solution to traffic. This is only a solution to traffic if you can somehow bypass the traffic at the airport. And most of the airports are really not designed for high throughput.\nLike the airports themselves – I’ve joked and said it’s like veal, they’re designed by people who raised veal. It’s like these huge buildings with no windows. And the food is terrible. And the ambiance is depressing. And it’s designed to sort of funnel people through at a slow speed.\nSo, I think something that… if you could bypass the airport, then a flying car could be useful. But I think the traffic at the airport would still be a problem. So, I’m not sure a flying car would solve traffic. It might help with traffic to the airport. But the traffic at the airport would still be a problem.\nI think things that help with vertical takeoff and landing, that’s helpful. If you can go directly from one place to another without having to go to an airport, that would be a big help. And then, the tunnels, I think would help a lot with traffic.

It’s like, it gets people excited about space, which is great. And we also showed that you can actually put large satellites like the James Webb Telescope with Falcon Heavy. And then we also demonstrated that we can reuse the boost stage. So, the first stage is the big thing that goes at the beginning of the flight. It’s what actually carrying most of the energy to orbit. The upper stage is like the brain and the muscles. The upper stage actually maneuvering the spacecraft, whether it’s putting a satellite in orbit or landing a spacecraft on Mars or something like that.\nThe boost stage is like the horse in the horse and cart. The horse is still important, but the cart is what really doing the work. So, we showed that we can actually recover the boost stage. In fact, we’ve recovered the boost stage for two different flights now. And on one of those flights, we actually over-recovered the boost stage. We landed it with precision that’s equivalent to landing a 747\/737 at the size of a parking lot.","answer":"Super-boring.
