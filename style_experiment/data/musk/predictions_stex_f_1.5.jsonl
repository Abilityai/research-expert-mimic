{"pred":" Well, I guess, working on solutions for existential risks for humanity, I think is something that I would work on. I think there’s a pretty good chance that we find some good solutions to the energy problems of the world, and we’re seeing that with the rapid growth of solar and wind. So that’s a good trend.\nI think there’s still a lot of work to be done in developing sustainable energy solutions for the developing world. So that’s a big challenge. Sustainable energy solutions for high population density areas, like the Middle East, where you’ve got a lot of sun, but you don’t have a lot of space, and you’ve got a lot of people, so you need to really cram a lot of energy into a small space.\nI think there’s a big challenge in the future of developing a sustainable energy transport system. So like, how do you make electric planes and supersonic electric jets and that kind of thing. And then, of course, there’s the challenge of becoming a multi-planet species and a spacefaring civilization. So I think those are all pretty exciting things.","answer":"Well, first of all, I think if somebody is doing something that is useful to the rest of society, I think that's a good thing. Like, it doesn't have to change theworld. If you make something that has high value to people... And frankly, even if it's something, if it's like just a little game or some improvement in photo sharing or something, if it has a small amount of good for a large number of people, It hink that's fine. Stuff doesn't need to change the world just to be good. But in terms of things that I think are most like to affect the future of humanity, I think AI is probably the single biggest item in the near-term that's likely to affect humanity. So, it's very important that we have the advent of AI in a good way. It's something that, if you could look into the crystal ball and to the future, you would like that outcome because it is something that could go wrong, as we've talked about many times. And so, we really need to make sure it goes right. So that's AI,working on AI and making sure it's great future. That's the most important thing, It hink, right now, the most pressing item. Then, I would say anything to do with genetics. If you can actually solve genetic diseases, if you can prevent dementia or Alzheimer's or something like that with genetic reprograming, that would be wonderful. So I think genetics might be the sort of second most important item. And then, I think, having a high-bandwidth interface to the brain. We're currently bandwidth-limited. We have a digital tertiary self in the form of out email capabilities, our computers, phones, applications. We're practically superhuman.

{"pred":" I was always curious about how things work. And I think that's pretty common. Kids are always asking, \"Why is it like that?\" And I think it's good to just be exposed to a lot of different things. I think I read a lot of books, and my parents took me on a lot of trips. And we went to Canada, and we went to the US, and we went to Mexico, and we went to Europe. And we just saw a lot of different things, and I was exposed to a lot of different cultures, and I think that was helpful. And then, I think, just generally, I was always interested in the future. I thought about the future a lot. And I was always trying to figure out, like, what are the things that would be the things that would affect the future in a big way. And then, I would try to read a lot about those things. And then, I would try to do things in that area.\nSo, like, one example is, I was trying to figure out what would affect the future in a big way. And I thought, well, the internet is something that's going to be big. And then, I tried to figure out, well, what's the most important thing on the internet? And I thought, well, the most important thing on the internet is going to be the thing that helps you find the most useful information, the fastest. And then, I realized that the way to do that is to figure out what questions you should ask. And then, the answers to those questions would be the most useful information. So then, I worked on a software called 'Questions and Answers' to try to figure out what are the right questions to ask. And then, you connect those questions to the answers. And then, you get better answers by iterating on the questions and the answers. And then, you can also see how other people have answered a question, and you can see how they've ranked relative to other people. And then, you can also see how you rank relative to other people. And so, it's a way of sort of self-improvement, also.\nAnd then, I thought, well, what's the most important question to answer? I think the most important question to answer is, \"What is the nature of the universe?\" And then, I realized that in order to answer the question, what is the nature of the universe, you actually have to answer two questions. One is, what is the nature of physics? And then, what is the meaning of life, or what is the purpose of life? And then, I realized that these are the two hardest questions in the universe. And then, I realized that there was a third question, which is, how can we expand the scope and scale of consciousness? And then, I realized that these were actually the three hardest questions in the universe. And then, I realized that there was actually a fourth question, which is, how can we ensure the future is good, ensure that civilization continues, and that the sort of small candle of consciousness in the void that is humanity continues and that the candle does not go out.","answer":"Well, first of all, I should say that I do not expect to be involved in all these things.

I didn't expect to be involved in all those things. Actually, at the time in college, I sort of thought helping with electrification of cars was how it would start out. That's actually what I worked on as an intern was advanced ultra-capacitors, to see if there would be a breakthrough relative to batteries for energy storage in cars. And then, when I came out to go to Stanford, that's what I was going to be doing my grad studies on was working on advanced energy storage technologies for electric cars. And I put that on hold to start an Internet company in '95 because there does seem to be a time for particular technologies when they're at a steep point in the inflection curve.

That’s probably a much more distant future, but I think we should have a Mars city as a backstop civilization. Just in case something goes wrong on Earth, we have a backstop civilization on Mars.

{"pred":" I mean, we’ve been profitable for the last three quarters. So it’s not like we’re burning through some crazy amount of money. I mean, we’re not a company that is in any danger of going out of business. I mean, we have $1.5 billion in the bank, and we’re profitable. So this idea that there’s some sort of financial constraint on us is not true.\nBut in order to grow the company, it is necessary to increase the amount of capital that the company has. And there are really two ways to increase the amount of capital a company has. One is to increase the amount of money that the company earns, and the other is to increase the amount of money that is invested in the company. And there’s really two ways to increase the amount that the company earns. One is to increase the number of cars and trucks that we produce, and the number of spacecraft that we build, and the number of satellites that we launch, and the number of Starlink terminals that we sell.\nAnd then the other is to improve the efficiency of the company. I think a lot of people don’t appreciate how hard it is to improve the efficiency of a company. It’s incredibly difficult. It’s much harder than making more stuff. Making more stuff is hard, but making something that doesn’t exist before is much harder than making more of something that already exists. But improving the efficiency of the company, there are just so many things that you have to keep in mind.\nFirst of all, you have to make sure that the company is not starving for money. If the company is starving for money, the company will die of starvation before it can be efficient. So you have to make sure that the company is not starving. Then you have to make sure that the company is not suffering from low morale. If the company is suffering from low morale, it’s going to be very difficult to improve the efficiency of the company. So you have to make sure that the morale is high.\nThen you have to make sure that the company is not suffering from low motivation. If the company is not motivated, it’s very difficult to improve the efficiency. Then you have to make sure that the company is not suffering from low productivity. If the company is not productive, it’s very difficult to improve the efficiency. Then you have to make sure that the company is not suffering from low quality. If the company is not making high quality products, it’s very difficult to improve the efficiency.\nSo there’s just so many things that you have to keep in mind in order to improve the efficiency of the company, and then you have to actually do it. And then, even if you improve the efficiency, but you don’t use that improved efficiency to make more products or provide better service, then nothing will happen. So you have to actually use the improved efficiency to make more products or provide better service.\nSo I would say that improving the efficiency of a company is probably ten times harder than making more stuff. But it is important to do both. And I think we’ve been doing both. I think we’ve been doing it very well. And we’re going to keep doing it. And I think we’re going to keep improving the efficiency of the company and making more products.\nAnd then, in terms of increasing the amount of money that is invested in the company, I think it’s important to appreciate that there’s a big difference between the money that is invested in a company and the money that a company earns. The money that a company earns is many times more than the money that is invested in the company. So if a company earns $100 billion a year, and $1 billion was invested in the company, that $1 billion investment will result in $100 billion of earnings.","answer":"You know ...

{"pred":" Yeah, I mean, I think it’s pretty great that Tesla is a public company and that people can buy our stock if they want or don’t buy our stock if they don’t want. I think that’s pretty great. And we have a lot of institutional investors and we have a lot of retail investors, and I think that’s also good. It’s kind of important that we don’t just have a bunch of people who are just institutional investors because then they could just, you know, “We don’t like the way Tesla’s run. We’re going to sell it and buy something else.” Well, okay, that’s up to them, but it’s also up to the retail investors to decide whether they want to buy Tesla or not. And if they don’t like how it’s run, then they shouldn’t buy it.\nAnd we’ve got a lot of retail investors. I mean, there are a lot of people who have, you know, $500 or $1,000 in Tesla stock, and that’s pretty cool. I think that’s a good thing. And then it’s also good to have institutional investors because they have a lot of money and they can help us grow. And some of them have very good ideas.\nI mean, one of the things that is actually quite helpful is that we have a lot of institutional investors who are pension funds and things that have a long-term time horizon. And some of them are actually quite good at, you know, value investing and stuff. And they’ll say, “Okay, we’re not going to sell Tesla just because the stock price went up or down. And we’re going to look at Tesla on a long-term basis and say, is Tesla doing good or bad?”\nAnd I think that’s actually pretty helpful because sometimes the public market can get a little too much into the short-term. And then also, it’s good to have the short-term and the long-term. I think it’s actually pretty good that we have that. And also, we have a lot of retail investors who are just people who just believe in Tesla or think that what we’re doing is good.\nAnd sometimes the retail investors are actually better than the institutional investors because they just believe in Tesla because they think it’s cool or because they think it’s good for the world, or they just like cars. And they’re not just doing it because it’s some sort of a spreadsheet analysis. And that’s actually pretty great, too. I think it’s good to have a variety of people that have a variety of time horizons and for different reasons are owning Tesla stock.","answer":"Yeah, you know, not to harp on those short-sellers, because people think I have this obsession with them, but I spent like 1 percent [or] less of time thinking about them —","messages":[{"content":"Do you need to go private?
