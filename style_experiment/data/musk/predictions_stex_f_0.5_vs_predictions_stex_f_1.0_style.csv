Thanks for having me., Great to be here.," Hey, great to be here.",B,A
"Well, first of all, I think if somebody is doing something that is useful to the rest of society, I think that's a good thing. Like, it doesn't have to change theworld. If you make something that has high value to people... And frankly, even if it's something, if it's like just a little game or some improvement in photo sharing or something, if it has a small amount of good for a large number of people, It hink that's fine. Stuff doesn't need to change the world just to be good. But in terms of things that I think are most like to affect the future of humanity, I think AI is probably the single biggest item in the near-term that's likely to affect humanity. So, it's very important that we have the advent of AI in a good way. It's something that, if you could look into the crystal ball and to the future, you would like that outcome because it is something that could go wrong, as we've talked about many times. And so, we really need to make sure it goes right. So that's AI,working on AI and making sure it's great future. That's the most important thing, It hink, right now, the most pressing item. Then, I would say anything to do with genetics. If you can actually solve genetic diseases, if you can prevent dementia or Alzheimer's or something like that with genetic reprograming, that would be wonderful. So I think genetics might be the sort of second most important item. And then, I think, having a high-bandwidth interface to the brain. We're currently bandwidth-limited. We have a digital tertiary self in the form of out email capabilities, our computers, phones, applications. We're practically superhuman. But we're extremely bandwidth-constrained in that interface between the cortex and that tertiary digital form of yourself. And helping solve that bandwidth constraint would be, I think, very important in the future as well. Yeah."," Well, I think I’d probably still be working on the same things. I mean, I think the things that are most important are the things that are going to affect the future of humanity and the future of life on Earth. So, I think the things that are most important are the things that are going to affect the future of humanity and the future of life on Earth."," Well, I think the five problems that I thought were most important when I was 22 were probably not the right problems.",A,A
"Well, first of all, I should say that I do not expect to be involved in all these things. So, the five things that I thought about at the time in college, so quite along time ago, 25 years ago, making life multi-planetary, accelerating the transmission to sustainable energy, the Internet broadly speaking, and then genetics, and AI. I didn't expect to be involved in all those things. Actually, at the time in college, I sort of thought helping with electrification of cars was how it would start out. That's actually what I worked on as an intern was advanced ultra-capacitors, to see if there would be a breakthrough relative to batteries for energy storage in cars. And then, when I came out to go to Stanford, that's what I was going to be doing my grad studies on was working on advanced energy storage technologies for electric cars. And I put that on hold to start an Internet company in '95 because there does seem to be a time for particular technologies when they're at a steep point in the inflection curve. And I didn't want to do a PHD atStanford and watch it all happen. I wasn't entirely certain that the technology I'd be working on would succeed. You can get a doctorate on many things that ultimately do not a have practical bearing on the world. And I really was just trying to be useful. That's the optimization. It's like, ""What can I do that would actually be useful?"""," Well, I think I've been very fortunate in that I've been able to start companies and have them succeed. And I think that's a big deal. I think a lot of people have great ideas, but they don't succeed in executing on those ideas. And I think that's a big deal. I think it's important to have a high success rate in starting companies. I think that's a big deal. And I think I've been able to do that. And I think that's a big deal. I think it's important to have a high success rate in starting companies. I think that's a big deal. And I think I've been able to do that. And I think that's a big deal.", I read a lot of books and I thought about the future a lot.,B,B
Mostly not.," I think it depends on what you want to do. If you want to do fundamental research, then a PhD is probably a good idea. If you want to do something that's more practical, then a PhD is probably not a good idea.", I think a PhD is a good way to get useful things done.,A,A
"Some yes, but mostly not."," I think the way to be useful is to try to understand the world as it is, not as you wish it to be, and to try to take actions that are in the service of the truth.", I think the way to be useful is to do useful things.,B,A
"Well, I think you make some estimates of, whatever this thing is that you're trying to create, what would be the utility delta compared to the current state of the art times how many people it would affect. So that's why I think having something that makes a big difference but affects sort of small to moderate number of people is great, as is something that makes even a small difference but affects a vast number of people. Like, the area under the curve."," I think you should try to do things that you think are useful, and then if they’re not useful, you should stop doing them.", I think they should try to do things that they love doing and that are useful to other people.,A,A
"Yeah, exactly. I mean, the area under the curve would actually be roughly similar for those two things, so it's actually really about just trying to be useful and matter.", Yeah.," Yeah, so you can think of it like, say, how many lives would it affect, and how much would it improve those lives. And then you can also think about it in terms of, how many years would it add to people's lives, or how many years could it extend people's lives. And then you can also think about it in terms of, how much happiness would it create, or how much suffering would it alleviate.",B,B
"Very crazy. For sure. They were not shy of saying that. But I agreed with them that it was quite crazy. Crazy...if the objective was to achieve the best risk-adjusted return, starting off a company is insane. But that was not my objective. I'd soon come to a conclusion that if something didn't happen to improve rocket technology, we'd be stuck on earth forever. And the big aerospace companies had just had no interest in radical innovation. All they wanted to do was try tomake their old technology slightly better every year. And in fact, sometimes it would actually get worse. Particularly in rockets, it was pretty bad. In '69 we were able to go to the moon with the Saturn 5. And then the space shuttle could onlytake people to low-earth orbit. And then the space shuttle retired. And that trend basically trends to zero. People sometimes think technology just automatically gets better every year but actually it doesn't. It only gets better if smart people work like crazy to make it better. That's how any technology actually gets better. By itself, technology, if people don't work at it, actually will decline. Look at the history of civilizations,many civilizations. Look at, say, ancient Egypt, where they were able to build these incredible pyramids and then they basically forgot how to build pyramids. And even hieroglyphics. They forgot how to read hieroglyphics. Or if you look atRome and how they were able to build these incredible roadways and aqueduct sand indoor plumbing, they forgot how to do all of those things. There are many such examples in history. So I think we should always bear in mind that entropy is not on your side."," Yeah, it was.", 2001.,B,A
"Well, first of all I'd say I actually think I feel fear quite strongly. So it's not as though I just have the absence of fear. I feel it quite strongly. There are just times when something is important enough that you believe in it enough that you do it in spite of fear."," I think it's important to remember that if you're going to do something that's difficult, you're going to be told it's crazy."," I think I'm just not that afraid of death. I think maybe that's quite important. I think a lot of people really fear death, and they don't want to die, and they don't want their loved ones to die. And I think that's a very powerful force. I mean, I've seen many people die, and I've been with people when they died. And I've been with people when they've died, and I've been with people when they've died, and I've been with people when they've died.",B,B
"It's like, people shouldn't think, well, ""I feel fear about this and therefore I shouldn't do it,"" it's normal to feel fear. Like, you'd have to have something mentally wrong with you if you don't feel fear."," I mean, I think it's important to be able to take risks and to be able to take risks that are important to you. And I think if you're going to take risks, you should take risks that are important to you."," I mean, I think it's important to be able to do things that are difficult and that you're not sure you can do. And then you do them. And then you feel good.",B,B
"Yeah. You know, actually something that can be helpful is fatalism, to some degree. If you just accept the probabilities, then that diminishes fear. When starting SpaceX, I thought the odds of success were less than 10% and I just accepted that actually probably I would just lose everything. But that maybe would make some progress. If we could just move the ball forward, even if we died, maybe some other company could pick up the baton and keep moving it forward, so we'd still do some good. Yeah, same with Tesla. I thought the odds ofa car company succeeding were extremely low.", Yeah., Yeah.,B,A
"Well, oddly enough, I actually think they're pretty good.", I think there's a good chance that we will get to Mars in the next 15 to 20 years.," Well, I think we have a good chance of sending an uncrewed vehicle to Mars as early as next year. And then, in 2029, we have a window to send a crew. So I think we have a very good chance of being able to establish a self-sustaining city on Mars in this century.",B,A
"I hope I'm not in some realm of self-delusion here. But look at it this way: at this point, I'm certain there is a way. I'm certain that success is one of possible outcomes for establishing a self-sustaining Mars colony, a growing Mars colony. I'm certain that is possible. Whereas until maybe a few years ago, I was not sure that success was even one of the possible outcomes. In terms of having some meaningful number of people going to Mars, I think this is potentially something that can be accomplished in about 10 years. Maybe sooner, maybe nine years. Indeed to make sure that SpaceX doesn't die between now and then and that I don't die, or if I do die, that someone takes over who will continue that.", I think you can come back.," Yeah, absolutely.",A,A
"Yeah, exactly. The first launch will be robotic anyway.", I'm not going on the first launch., I'll go on the second launch.,A,A
"Yeah, the internet latency would be pretty significant. Mars is roughly 12 light minutes from the sun and Earth is 8 light minutes. So, the closest approach to Mass is four light minutes away. The furthest approach is 20. A little more because you can't sort of talk directly through the sun."," Yeah, the latency is a problem."," Yeah, it’s going to be great.",A,A
"Okay, I mean I do want to emphasize that this is not really something that I advocate or this is not prescriptive. This is simply, hopefully, predictive. Because you will hear some say, well, like this is something that I want to occur instead of this is something I think that probably is the best of the available alternatives. The best of the available alternatives that I can come up with, and maybe someone else can come up with a better approach or better outcome, is that we achieve democratization of AI technology. Meaning that no one company or small set of individuals has control over advanced AI technology. I think that's very dangerous. It could also get stolen by somebody bad, like some evil dictator or country could send their intelligence agency to go steal it and gain control. It just becomes a very unstable situation, I think, if you've got any incredibly powerful AI. You just don't know who's going to control that. So it's not that I think that the risk is that the AI would develop a will of its own right off the bat. I think the concern is that someone may use it in a way that is bad. Or even if they weren't going to use it in a way that's bad but somebody could take it from them and use it in a way that's bad, that, I think, is quite a big danger. So I think we must have democratization of AI technology to make it widely available. And that's the reason that obviously you, me, and the rest of the team created OpenAI was to help spread out AI technology so it doesn't get concentrated in the hands of a few. But then, of course, that needs to be combined with solving the high-bandwidth interface to the cortex.", I think we should take the actions necessary to ensure that AI is a force for good. I think we should take the actions necessary to ensure that AI is a force for good.," I think AI is a really big deal. It's probably the biggest risk to the future of civilization. It's also one of the biggest opportunities for the future of civilization. So it's really how it's deployed and what regulations, if any, are put in place. I think it's pretty close to inevitable that there will be some sort of AI safety regulation. It's really just a question of when. I think it's also pretty close to inevitable that there will be some sort of generalized sentience. It's really just a question of when.",B,B
"Humans are so slow. Yes, exactly. But we already have a situation in ourb rain where we've got the cortex and the limbic system... The limbic system is kind of a...I mean, that's the primitive brain. That's kind of like your instincts and whatnot. And the cortex is the thinking upper part of the brain. Those two seem to work together quite well. Occasionally, your cortex and limbic system will disagree, but they..."," Yeah, we're so slow."," Yeah, we're so slow.",B,A
"Generally works pretty well, and it's like rare to find someone who...I've notfound someone wishes to either get rid of the cortex or get rid of the limbic system.", It generally works pretty well., Yes.,A,A
"Yeah, that's unusual. So I think if we can effectively merge with AI by improving the neural link between your cortex and your digital extension of yourself, which already, like I said, already exists, just has a bandwidth issue. And then effectively you become an AI-human symbiote. And if that then is widespread, with anyone who wants it can have it, then we solve the control problem as well, we don't have to worry about some evil dictator AI because we are the AI collectively. That seems like the best outcome I can think of."," It's like, okay, we're going to keep those."," Yeah, it's like, what are you going to do? Cut it off?",B,B
I think it's going pretty well. I think we've got a really talented group at OpenAI., I think they're doing great., I think they're doing great.,B,A
"Yeah, a really talented team and they're working hard. OpenAI is structured as a 501(c)(3) non-profit. But many non-profits do not have a sense of urgency. It's fine, they don't have to have a sense of urgency, but OpenAI does because I think people really believe in the mission. I think it's important. And it's about minimizing the risk of existential harm in the future. And so I think it's going well. I'm pretty impressed with what people are doing and the talent level. And obviously, we're always looking for great people to join in the mission.", Yeah., Yeah.,=,A
"My time is mostly split between SpaceX and Tesla. And of course, I try to spend a part of every week at OpenAI. So I spend basically half a day at OpenAI most weeks. And then I have some OpenAI stuff that happens during the week.But other than that, it's really SpaceX and Tesla.", I spend a lot of time at the factory. I'm there most days. I'm there every day. I'm there every day., I spend a lot of time on Twitter.,A,A
"Yes, it's a good question. I think a lot of people think I must spend a lot of time with media or on businessy things. But actually almost all my time, like 80% of it, is spent on engineering and design. Engineering and design, so it's developing next-generation product. That's 80% of it."," Well, I mean, I'm not sure how to describe it. I mean, I guess I'm just trying to make sure that the companies are successful. And I think we're making good progress on that front."," Well, I spend a lot of time on engineering and design. So I'll be in the factory, I'll be in the design studio, I'll be in the manufacturing area, and I'll be in the offices. I'll be with the engineers and the designers and the manufacturing team and the management team and just try to be helpful.",B,B
"Yeah. I think a lot of people think I'm kind of a business person or something, which is fine. Business is fine. But really it's like at SpaceX, Gwynne Shotwell is Chief Operating Officer. She manages legal, finance, sales, and general business activity. And then my time is almost entirely with the engineering team, working on improving the Falcon 9 and our Dragon spacecraft and developing the Mars Colonial architecture. At Tesla, it's working on the Model3 and, yeah, so I'm in the design studio, take up a half a day a week, dealing with aesthetics and look-and-feel things. And then most of the rest of the week is just going through engineering of the car itself as well as engineering of the factory. Because the biggest epiphany I've had this year is that what really matters is the machine that builds the machine, the factory. And that is at least two orders of magnitude harder than the vehicle itself.", I'm an engineer., I do have a lot of respect for engineering.,B,A
"Yeah. Now, this actually has a relatively lower level of automation compared to what the Gigafactory will have and what Model 3 will have.", Yeah.," Yeah, it's pretty crazy.",A,B
"Actually our speed on the line is incredibly slow. I think we are...in terms of the extra velocity of vehicles on the line, it's probably about, including both X andS, it's maybe five centimeters per second. This is very slow.", I think it's 200 a minute., I think it's about 100 meters a minute.,B,B
"I'm confident we can get to at least one meter per second. So, a 20-fold increase.", I think we could probably go to 100 kilometers an hour.," I mean, ideally, you'd like to have a velocity of at least a meter per second on the line. So you can make a lot of cars if you have a meter per second of velocity. And then you just need to have a long line.",B,B
"Yeah. At least. I mean, I think quite a...one meter per second, just to put into perspective, is a slow walk or a medium-speed walk. A fast walk could be one and a half meters per second. And then the fastest humans can run over 10 meters per second.", Yes., 200 kilometers an hour. That's 0.2 of a second.,B,B

"Well, I tweet interesting things pretty much as they come to me, and probably with not much of a filter."," Well, I mean, I think Twitter is a good way to get a sense of what’s going on in the world. I think it’s a good way to get a sense of what’s going on in the world."," Well, I think Twitter is a very useful tool for getting a message out. And I think it’s also a way to get feedback. I think it’s a way to get a sense of what people think. And I think it’s also a way to get a sense of what the media thinks.

"I find it entertaining. I think, “Oh, other people might find this entertaining.” Sometimes they do.", I think it’s a good way to communicate with people., I think it’s a good way to get a message out quickly.,A,A

"Yeah. It’s pretty interesting what my most ... What people are most interested in, like some little tweet about “I love anime.” That was it. But it was lowercase “i”, black heart, “anime,” and people loved that. That was like one of my most popular tweets.", Yeah.," Yeah, they do.",B,A
Not really. I think it’s mostly just if it’s something that might cause a substantial movement in the stock during trading hours. That’s about it.," I mean, I’m not going to change my Twitter behavior. I’m going to be me.", I think I can still do memes.,B,A
"I look at it as a way to learn things, kinda stay in touch with what’s happening. It feels like dipping into the flow of consciousness of society. That’s what it feels like. It’s kinda weird. I guess I sometimes use Twitter to express myself, and that’s a weird thing to do, I suppose."," Yeah, I mean, I think it’s a good way to communicate with people."," It’s a way of… You know, there’s a way to sort of communicate with people.",B,A

"The amount of untruthful stuff that is written is unbelievable. Takethat Wall Street Journal front-page articleabout, like, “The FBI is closing in.” That is utterly false. That’s absurd. To print such a falsehood on the front page of a major newspaper is outrageous. Like, why are they even journalists? They’re terrible. Terrible people."," Well, I think the press has been very dishonest.", I think they’re generally not very good at their job.,B,A
"The answer is for the press to be honest and truthful, and research their articles and correct things properly when they are false. Which they don’t do.", I’m not attacking the press. I’m attacking falsehoods., I’m not attacking the press. I’m simply pointing out that they are wrong.,B,A
"Yes, of course I do.", I understand that there are some people who don’t like the press., I understand that you’re trying to say that I should be censored.,A,A
I suggest the press take it to heart and do better., I think we’re going to be fine. I think we’re going to be fine., I think we should take the actions that are most likely to make the future better and less likely to make the future worse.

"Yeah.

Ford and Tesla made it barely through the last recession. There’s a good chance Ford doesn’t make it in the next recession.

Drive on Navigation?," Yeah, so we’ve got a new navigation system that’s coming out. It’s really great. It’s got a bunch of new features. It’s got real-time traffic, real-time road construction, and it’s got a new map. The map is much better. It’s got a lot more detail. It’s got a lot more information. It’s got a lot more points of interest. It’s got a lot more data. It’s got a lot more data."," Oh, yeah. So, we’re rolling out navigation to the whole fleet. It’s been in beta for a while. I think it’s pretty good. It’s getting better every day. We’re rolling out lane guidance and speed limits and traffic lights and stop signs and all that kind of thing. And then we’re going to roll out the full self-driving computer and sensors and the car will just drive itself.",A,A
"That’s I think one of the first major steps toward full self-driving. You can enter in an address, and from highway on-ramp to highway off-ramp, the car will change lanes. It will go from one highway to the next automatically, and take off-ramp automatically. It’s pretty wild. It’ll overtake a slow car. It’s basically integrating navigation with the Autopilot capability. That’s why we call it Navigate on Autopilot, or Drive on Nav.", It’s pretty good.," So, you can just drive down the highway, and it’ll just keep you in the lane, and if you get into the lane of another highway, it’ll just transition smoothly from one highway to another. And then, if you want to take an exit, you just use the turn signal, and then it’ll slow down, and then take the exit, and then accelerate back up to speed.",B,B
"Well, the main challenge has been improving the neural net so that we can recognize all types of objects from all eight cameras. There are eight cameras: Three forward, two on each side, and one rear. The big challenge has been solving a wide range of corner cases. So if you have a —"," Well, I think the biggest thing is that the car needs to be able to handle any situation that a person can handle. So, it’s not like the car is going to be perfect. It’s going to make mistakes. But the car needs to be able to handle any situation that a person can handle. And then, it needs to be able to learn from those mistakes and improve."," Well, I think the biggest thing is that people are still dying in cars. And that’s not good. So, we really need to get autonomy right. And we need to get it out there as fast as possible. The thing that’s going to really get people to adopt self-driving is that it’s much safer than a person. By a lot. By a factor of maybe 10 or more. So, people are going to say, “Okay, I’m going to let the computer do the driving because it’s much safer.” That’s the thing that’s going to really make it go viral, so to speak.
And then, the other thing is that it needs to be affordable. It needs to be available to people who can’t afford a new car. So, it’s got to be available on a subscription basis or something like that. And it’s got to be really hands-off. You just turn it on, and it works. You don’t have to think about it.",B,A
"Yeah, the roads are pretty messy, so you could have, say, skid marks on the road that look like a line. Sometimes tar seams look like a line. Sometimes the lines are just painted wrong, for some reason. One of our biggest challenges, actually, with Drive on Navigation was dealing with forks and gores, where if a lane is splitting, you need to be confident that you’re going either left or right, not down the center. And the car will come to a halt at the first intersection.
Now we’re integrating stop signs, traffic lights, being able to do, say, hard right turns or hairpin bends and that kind of thing.", Yeah.," Yeah, so you have a neural net that’s trying to recognize objects, and it’s trying to figure out what is the object, and what is the shape of the object, and what is the orientation of the object. And then, once it has a good understanding of the object, then it can figure out what actions to take in order to navigate around that object.",B,B
"Yeah, we’re not really thinking about it.

"No. The car needs to drive better than a human driver using the same inputs as a human driver. Eyes are basically just cameras. All creatures on Earth navigate with cameras. A fish eagle can see a fish from far away and take into account the refractive index of the water, dive down and get the fish from far away. There’s no question that image-recognition neural nets and cameras, you can be superhuman at driving with just cameras.", I’m not assuming.

"Yeah, that’s hopeless. That would, at best, be a specialized solution, and whatever city puts stuff in roads ... You can always make something work for a specific solution, like some special-case solution in some town, you can make that easy, but what you really want is a general solution for self-driving that works worldwide.
I’d love you to sort of assess the competitive landscape.Faraday just lost another founder today, which was the hot company, or the allegedly hot company, I think that’s probably easier to say it that way.Lucid got a billion dollars.How do you assess — Google’s working on stuff, Uber still seems to be hanging in there. I’d love to get your assessment of all of them.
Yeah. I don’t really think that much about competitors. I just say like, you know, how do we make our cars as good as possible? How do we make sure we have like the best engineering and manufacturing talent in the world?

"You know ... I mean, as I said earlier this year, I think we will be cash-flow positive for all quarters going forward."," Well, I mean, we’re going to have to raise more money. I think we’re going to have to raise money from the public. I think we’re going to have to have a public offering of some kind. I don’t know if it’s a traditional IPO or something else, but we’re going to have to raise money from the public. And I think we’re going to have to do that as soon as possible."," Well, I have a lot of money, and I’m willing to put a lot of money into this. I don’t know if I’ll put in a billion dollars or something like that. I mean, that’s not out of the question. And I’ve got a bunch of options that are expiring early next year that I’m planning to exercise, and that will also provide a lot of money. So I think I can get this to the point where it’s either profitable or at least looking very promising. And then I think I’ll be able to find investors. I mean, I think this is a pretty compelling thing. It’s a pretty compelling idea.",B,A
"No, I don’t think so.", I think we will be cash-flow positive for all quarters going forward.," No, I think we’re actually going to have a significant amount of cash.",B,A
We don’t need to go private. I think we could execute better if we were private.," I don’t know. I mean, I think we’re going to have to do something to go private. I mean, we’re going to have to do something to not be publicly traded. I don’t know what that is. I think we’re going to have to do something."," No, I don’t think going private is necessarily the right move.",A,B
"Yeah, you know, not to harp on those short-sellers, because people think I have this obsession with them, but I spent like 1 percent [or] less of time thinking about them —", Yeah.," Yeah, I mean, it’s just… you know, when you’re public, you have to make every decision considering what is going to make the shareholders happy. And that’s not always what’s good for the company.",B,B
"Less than 1 percent of my tweets have anything to do with short-sellers. But the issue is that there’s a group of people who are quite smart, very mean, and have a strong financial interest in Tesla’s downfall.
And what that results in is a constant attack on the Tesla brand, on me personally, on the executive team, on our cars. You know, every mistake we make is amplified.
Going private would definitely result in some short-term drama. Let’s say we’re private, and then we went public five years from now. Then the area under the curve of brand damage by short-sellers would be probably less than the short-term difficulty of going private in the first place. That was the approximate calculus.
And then also being public, particularly when everyone at the company is a shareholder, causes a lot of distraction when the share price moves around a lot. It tends to end up being like a mood, to some degree, a mood thermometer. So it’s like the stock goes down, people are sad and feel undercompensated. And then when the stock goes up, people are exuberant, overly exuberant, and you get distracted thinking about what you’re going to buy."," And I’m like, “Why are they so obsessed with me?”"," I mean, I think it’s just like, you know, if you’re going to bet against a company, don’t bet against it publicly. Just, you know, if you’re going to, like, bet against a company, bet against it privately. Don’t bet against it publicly. That’s just, I think, bad karma.",B,B
"So, like, neither of these things are great. When you have big moves in the stock, this just causes a distraction."," So it’s like, okay, well, if we’re private, then the mood of the company is not going to be so affected by the stock price.", So I think being public is a distraction. And I think it’s actually a bad thing for the company to be public.,B,A

"I think it’s literally the most exciting product lineup of any company in the world. Certainly from a consumer standpoint. I’ll just go through the things that are publicly announced.
You’ve got the Model Y, which is the midsize SUV. You’ve got the Semi truck, which is, can be great for really heavy transport. It’ll be like the heaviest class of truck, of industrial truck.
We’ve got the next-generation Roadster. Which will be the fastest sports car on every dimension. Fastest acceleration, fastest top speed, best handling. It’s important to have an electric sports car that’s faster than the fastest gasoline sports car. And it helps address that halo effect that gasoline sports cars have. So I think it’s important to do that to show that, you know, electric is the best architecture.
Then we’ve got the pickup truck, which — actually, I’m personally most excited about the pickup truck."," Well, I think we’ll do the Roadster next year."," Well, I’m not sure exactly when we’ll be able to get the truck going. I think we can probably do that towards the end of this year. And then the Roadster, I think we’re looking at like early next year.",B,B
"Well I can’t talk about the details, but it’s gonna be like a really futuristic-like cyberpunk, “Blade Runner” pickup truck. It’s gonna be awesome, it’s gonna be amazing. This will be heart-stopping. It stops my heart. It’s like, oh, it’s great."," Well, I’ve always wanted to make a pickup truck. I mean, I’ve driven a lot of pickup trucks. I’ve driven a lot of them. And I’ve always wanted to make a pickup truck. And I think we can make a pickup truck that’s better than anything else."," Well, I love pickup trucks. I think they’re great. And I think there’s a lot of things you can do with a pickup truck that you can’t do with other vehicles. And it’s a very useful thing to have. And I think it’s going to be a really great product.",B,A
"You know, I actually don’t know if a lot of people will buy this pickup truck or not, but I don’t care."," Yeah, it’s like a Tesla Cybertruck."," Well, I don’t know if they’re actually buying it. It’s like one of those like ‘
Nevada Brothel

"I mean I do care, eventually, you know. Like sure, I care. We wanna get gasoline, diesel pickup trucks off the road.", I don’t care. I’m just trying to make something that I think is cool., I don’t care.,A,A
"It’s something I’ve been wanting to make for a long time. If there’s only a small number of people that like that truck, I guess we’ll make a more conventional truck in the future. But it’s the thing that I am personally most fired up about.", And replace them with electric trucks., And replace them with electric trucks.,B,A
"No. I rode motorbikes a lot when I was a kid. So I did, like, dirt biking and then rode a motorcycle on the road. And then I almost got killed when I was 17.

It’s 25 times higher., Yeah., It’s quite high.,B,B
"Yeah. Like organ donors. So, we’re not gonna make motorcycles.
But a few more Tesla products that are cool: We’re almost done with the development of the solar tile roof. So we have those on a few hundred roofs right now. And we’re just doing testing to make sure they have long-term durability."," Yeah, it’s like a donor-mobile."," Donor-mobiles. Yeah, it’s like — You know, it’s like, do they just drive around and collect people?",A,A
"Yeah, the solar tile roof where it looks like a normal, beautiful tile roof. But it’s actually solar. And, like, that development process is longer than we’d like, because we’ve got to make sure that the roof’s gonna stand up for 30 years."," Yeah. So, you can’t tell the difference.", Yeah.,A,A
"And even when you do accelerated lab testing on a solar roof, it still takes a while. And we’ve gotta put a lot of work into making the installation process easy, so it doesn’t take ages to install a roof.
Then we’ve got the Powerwall battery storage system. We’ve got the Powerpack, which is used for utilities on industrial scale. We’re gonna have some other exciting announcements on the stationary storage front. So when you —"," And, you know, go through all kinds of weather."," And then, the thing that’s really tricky is to make it look right.",B,B
"I can’t talk more about it, but there’s —"," Yeah, this is for homes."," Yeah, this is for homes. This is like a — You know, it’s like a large floor-standing cabinet. It’s like your clothes washer and dryer, sort of size.",B,A

"Well, it’d be ironic if that had happened. I have to be careful about tempting fate, because I think often the most ironic outcome is the most probable.
It just very often seems like reality tries to ... Actually, technically, there’s a friend of mine, Jonah Nolan, who had this like modification of Occam’s razor where he said he thinks “the most ironic outcome is the most likely.” And then I think that there’s some truth to that. And then also I think sometimes the most entertaining outcome is the most likely.", It’s not a joke.," I mean, it’s not a joke.",B,A
"We successfully launched the Falcon Heavy rocket, which is the most powerful rocket in the world by a factor of two. So that’s twice the power, twice the thrust of the next biggest rocket. And we actually launched a Tesla —myTesla Roadster — to Mars orbit. The reason we did that is actually because, normally, when a new rocket is launched, you just put a dummy payload, which is like a block of concrete or something."," Well, we’re trying to make life multi-planetary. So we’re working on a rocket called the Starship, which is designed to take large numbers of people to Mars and to the Moon and to anywhere in the solar system. And we’re also working on a rocket called the Falcon 9, which is designed to take small satellites to orbit.

"Super-boring. So we were like, okay, what is theleastboring thing we can launch?
And then next year, the exciting things are we’re gonna be launching astronauts for the first time to the space station. It’ll really be the first time a vehicle from the United States launches astronauts into orbit since the Space Shuttle, which —"," Not creative. So we thought, well, let’s make it interesting. So we put a car in orbit. And it’s going to be there for a very long time. It’s going to be there for millions of years."," Yeah, and it’s just like, “Hey, we got this rocket, it worked.” And then, the rocket will be in orbit around Earth, and then it’ll burn up upon re-entry.

"2010 or something like that? Since then, the United States has relied upon the Russian Soyuz, which actually recently has had some issues.
What do you think ofthe Space Force? The Trump Space Force?
Well, this may be a little controversial, but I actually like the idea. I think it’s cool. You know, like, when the Air Force was formed, there was a lot of like pooh-poohing, and like, “Oh, how silly to have an Air Force!” You know, because the aircraft in World War II were managed by the Army."," Yeah, it’s been a while."," Yeah, it’s been a while.",=,A
"And so you had the Army and the Navy and the Coast Guard and the Marines, and then ... it became pretty obvious that you really needed a specialized division to manage aircraft. And so the Air Force was created.
And people today may not realize back then it was wildly panned as a ridiculous thing to create the Air Force, but now everyone’s like, “Obviously, you should have an Air Force.” And I think it’s gonna become obvious that we should have a Space Force, too."," And then, the Air Force was formed, and it was like, “Oh, okay, this is a good idea.” So, I think the same thing will happen with the Space Force. It’s like, “Oh, okay, this is a good idea.”"," And they were just like, “Oh, we don’t need a separate Air Force. That’s silly.” But then, obviously, once aircraft could go higher and faster than the speed of bullets, then it was like, “Okay, it’s pretty important to have a separate Air Force.” I think the same is true for space. You know, the things that we’re doing with SpaceX, the things that Blue Origin are doing, the things that Boeing and Lockheed are doing – these are important things that are going to affect the future of humanity, really. I think it’s pretty exciting.",B,B
"You know, it’s basically defense in space. And then I think also it could be pretty helpful for maybe expanding our civilization ... You know, expanding things beyond Earth.
I think we could just have a base on the moon, for example. A base on Mars. Be great to expand on the idea of a Space Force. Anyone who has an exploratory spirit, and I think that especially applies to a country like the United States, where you know it’s kind of the distillation of the spirit of human exploration. I think the idea of being out there among the stars and among the planets is very exciting."," Well, I think there’s a lot of things that Space Force could do. I think it’s important to have a military presence in space. I think it’s important to have a civilian presence in space. I think we should have a base on the Moon. I think we should have a base on Mars. I think we should have a base on an asteroid. I think we should have a base on the asteroid belt. I think we should have a base on the asteroid belt."," Well, I think we want to be careful about having a lot of civilizational eggs in one basket. And right now, I think we have a lot of eggs in the basket of Earth. And so, if we want to have a secure future, I think we want to have a self-sustaining city on Earth and a self-sustaining city in space. And I think we want to have that as soon as possible.

"Yeah, I certainly think NASA should continue to exist, NASA does a lot of really useful things, and these go beyond astronaut transport. There are missions to rovers on Mars that are thanks to NASA. There are these planetary probes, there’s the Hubble Telescope. NASA does a tremendous amount of good, and ideally we should actually increase the budget of NASA. I think it’s high time that we went beyond Earth orbit again. I think it’s very exciting and inspiring, and I think it really gets the whole world fired up.

"No, I don’t generally acquire things.", No., No.,B,A
"I create companies, but I don’t really acquire them. So I wouldn’t ... I have no plans. It does seem to be popular these days.

Oh, great, yeah. Eric’s been a great supporter.", I don’t generally acquire things., I don’t think I would be allowed to.,A,A
"Yeah, Eric’s been really supportive of our activity in L.A. I mean, technically, our first tunnels are in Hawthorne. But we do expect to, over time, create a network of tunnels under greater L.A. And I think this is really the key to getting around the city very fast. You’ve got to go 3-D. Our offices are 3-D and dense, but we then have a 2-D road transport network."," Yeah, exactly. So we’re going to do a test tunnel in LA. It’s going to be about a mile long, and we’re going to do it in the space of about a year. And then we’ll do a demonstration vehicle, and then we’ll do sort of a full-on production vehicle. And then we’ll do it in other places.
So the first one will be in LA, and then we’ll do one in DC, and then we’ll do one in New York, and then we’ll do one in San Francisco. And then we’ll do it in other places in the world. And then we’ll have a network of tunnels that can take you from anywhere in the city to anywhere else in the city at high speed."," Yeah, I mean, it’s pretty crazy. I mean, I was in LA for 15 years, and I’ve been to LA since I was a kid. And it’s just like, it’s always been bad, but it’s like worse. It’s like, it’s a lot worse.",A,A
"Yeah, many levels of tunnels, so —"," Yeah, you’ve got to go 3-D."," Yeah, you can’t have a tunnel with just one road in it.",B,B
"Yeah, but even subways tend to be essentially two-dimensional. You’ll have a subway cross another subway, but they’ve never really tried to make many layers of subways. The cost of tunneling, historically, has been prohibitive. And they’ve also been incredibly slow. The typical cost for a subway, per-mile cost for a subway in the U.S. has been about a billion dollars a mile, so that is not a very scalable solution."," Yeah, but it’s like a subway on steroids."," Yeah, it’s just that this would be a subway system that is 3D. So, instead of having two levels, you could have 100 levels, and so it can alleviate any traffic that you could possibly imagine.",B,B
"You could certainly have a subway system which had many layers of tunnels, but the tunnels are so prohibitively expensive that they don’t do it. But you can go down 100 levels if you want to; you could have 100 layers of tunnels on top of each other. You can go further down than you can go up. So the deepest mines are much deeper than the tallest buildings. But, really, the key is a massive improvement in tunneling technology. That’s the linchpin, that’s fundamentally what it amounts to. And as I got sort of digging into tunnels ... Ha-ha, good one."," Yeah, tunnels."," Yeah, tunnels.",B,A
