We have made our supercharger system open access. We've made our charger technology available for free to the other manufacturers., I believe we have not done that.," We have not shared our technology for charging, but we did make it known that all along that we would make our charging standard available to anyone who wanted to use it for free. And we did the same thing with our supercharger system. And we even went so far as to show other companies how to build a charger and how to build a supercharger. And we even gave them our patents for free.
And we did this publicly, you know, we didn’t do it privately. We just said, “Look, if you want to use this, you can use it. Here’s how you do it.” And I think it’s going to come as a big surprise to a lot of people that the charging network is going to be good. And that there will be long-range electric cars that can use the charging network.
And I think it’s also going to come as a big surprise that the supercharger system will be good. And that there will be long-range electric cars that can use the supercharger system. And that the supercharger system will be able to support long-range electric cars.
And I think it’s also going to come as a big surprise that the supercharger system will be good. And that there will be long-range electric cars that can use the supercharger system. And that the supercharger system will be able to support long-range electric cars.

One is that there’s a lot of fundamental physics that we don’t know. And we’re made of atoms and those atoms are made of quarks and leptons and those quarks and leptons have been around since the beginning of the universe. And the universe is 13.8 billion years old and has been around for 13.8 billion light years. And the things that we call atoms and elements are just the same thing in a different form. And so, if you say, what is the smartest thing in the room? Is it the atom or is it the human being? The human being is the smartest thing in the room by far. And we’re just a tiny, tiny, tiny fraction of the age of the universe.
So there’s a lot of fundamental physics that we don’t know. And there may be things that are out there that are fundamentally dangerous to the existence of life as we know it. And we should try to understand more about the nature of the universe and the existence of life and what is the meaning of life and what is the purpose of life. And I think the more we expand the scope and scale of consciousness, which is what I think we’re doing here with Neuralink, the more we understand about the nature of the universe and the meaning of life. And so that’s one reason."," Well, there’s a few reasons. One is that there’s just a lot of value in life itself. You know, there’s a reason that people are willing to sacrifice for their children and for others who are not even related to them. There’s just a lot of value in life. And we should take whatever actions we can think of to extend life and make it better.
And then, also, we want to be able to one day say we are a multi-planet species. I think that is a very exciting thing. And then, also, if we are able to one day expand to many planets and really become a spacefaring civilization, then we are much less likely to die out. You know, if you’re like the only candle in the room and that candle goes out, it’s dark. But if there’s a whole bunch of candles in the room, and one candle goes out, it’s not so dark. So, it’s really a question of long-term existence.","{

Supervised full self-driving is somewhere around four times safer or maybe more than just a human driving by themselves.," Well, I think it’s important to say that even with the current Autopilot, which is not full self-driving, but the current Autopilot is still roughly 50% safer than the average person. So that’s a 50% reduction in injuries with Autopilot compared to just relying on the person. And that’s with the person being actively trying to watch the road and intervene if necessary. So with full self-driving, I would expect that to be at least an order of magnitude better than that. So, at least ten times safer than the average person."," Roughly, I would say, it’s at least an order of magnitude safer. I mean, just to give sort of anecdotal evidence. I was just in the car, and we were driving down the highway, and I turned to the person next to me and said, “You know, I think we’re about to have an accident,” and I braked hard, and the car behind me braked hard. If I hadn’t braked hard, they would have hit us. So, like, that’s just one example of many.","{

"We literally make more electric cars than everyone else combined. Why are we not allowed?

We focus on making the best products and Tesla has gotten to where it’s gotten with no advertising at all.," I think our approach to product development is very good. We really try to make products that people love. And we try to make sure that every little thing, the design of every part, is maximizing the functional aesthetic, so it has to serve a purpose and look great.
And we try to make sure that our customers love the product, that they would recommend it to their friends and family. And we try to be as transparent as possible about the product. So you can see what’s going on. And if you go to our factories, we have a factory tour where you can see exactly what’s going on. And we try to be as open as possible.
I think that’s very important. And we also try to listen to our customers and try to make the product better based on what they’re saying. So if there’s some feature that they really want, and it makes sense to add that feature, we’ll try to add that feature. And if there’s some feature that they don’t like, and it’s within our power to change that, we’ll try to change it."," Well, I think the first thing is to have a product that people love. And we do have products that people love, or most people love them. There are a few people who don’t like our products, but most people do. And word of mouth is the most powerful advertising there is. If a product is good, and if it really changes people’s lives positively, then then people will talk about it. They will use their words, and they will tell their friends and neighbors, and write it on the internet.
So, the fundamental principle is to make products that are truly great, that people love, that change their lives positively, and then word of mouth will take care of the rest. And we’ve found this to be true. We have many people who have recommended Tesla to their friends, and they’ve bought Tesla because their friends recommended it, and they’ve never even heard of Tesla advertising.","{

"These demons of the mind are, for the most part, harnessed to productive ends."," Well, I think I've come to understand the nature of thought and the mind and the brain to a certain degree. I mean, I'm not a neuroscientist, but I do a lot of work in neuroscience because I think it is the thing that is the foundation of the future. In order to understand the future, you must understand the brain. And the future is coming fast, so we must understand the brain fast.
I mean, I've come to the conclusion that, like, the mind is a series of thought constructs, and there are two levels of thought constructs. There's the slow, kind of, diffuse thought constructs, which are like the river of thought. And then there are the fast, kind of, pointillist thought constructs, which are like the individual blobs of color in the river of thought. And these can be edited, and they're not coherent. And when you edit these fast thought constructs, it feels like you're editing reality.
Now, this is quite disconcerting because it feels like if you can edit these fast thought constructs, which you can do, and you can edit reality, then what is reality? And so, I think, one of the things that Neuralink is trying to do is to provide a high bandwidth interface to the brain such that we can better understand these thought constructs, the nature of the mind, the brain. And I think it could also provide a means for us to be symbiotic with A.I."," Well, I wouldn't say that I have harnessed all of them, but I've made some good use of some of them. And then, there's some that I'm just trying to like contain them, like keep them from bothering other people. I mean, I have a lot of drive, and I'm not sure where that comes from. I think it's just genetic, basically. I mean, I was reading about, what is it? The 'heritability' of various traits. And the heritability of drive or ambition is very high. That's mostly genes, and I got a lot of that from my mom's side. My mom's family was always like very ambitious. My great-grandfather, on my mom's side, started the first newspaper in Canada. My grandpa was the mayor of the town, and my dad was the deputy mayor. And then my mom was valedictorian of her high school, and then she went to medical school. And then she was like the chief of staff at the hospital. And then she became the head of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Ottawa. And then she did a fellowship at Stanford. And then she came back to Ottawa and did research at the hospital. And then she became the head of the hospital. She was the first female head of a hospital in Canada.
And then my uncles were very successful. One of my uncles was the chief engineer at Nortel, and he designed basically the backbone of the internet. And another uncle was the chief engineer at the Canadian Space Agency. And then another uncle was the head of the physics department at the University of Ottawa. And then another one was the head of the department of computer science at the University of Ottawa. And then another one was the head of the department of mathematics at the University of Ottawa. And then another one was the head of the department of economics at the University of Ottawa. It's like they just kept going up the ladder. And then my mom's brother married my dad's brother's wife. So they're like... I don't know, it's like we're like some sort of weird genetic experiment.","{

And we’re here on Earth, and Earth is great, but it’s not like the sort of ‘n’th’ planet from the sun. We’re actually on the first planet. So, if we don’t do things to ensure the long-term survival of humanity, I think eventually we’re just going to be like the proverbial one-planet civilization that dies out.

"By far our toughest competition is in China. China is super good at manufacturing, and the work ethic is incredible."," I would say China. Not because of the competition, but because they have, I think, a very ambitious electric vehicle market share goal. I think it's 20% of all cars sold in China by 2025 are expected to be electric. That's a pretty high percentage. And then they also have an aggressive local production requirement. I think it's currently around 80% of cars sold in China need to be locally produced. And then there's also an additional requirement for new energy vehicles, which is a combination of electric and fuel cell. That's 12% a year, I believe, for the next three years."," Well, I don't really look at other companies as competition. I think that if we both succeed, that's a good outcome. And generally, I would say that there are other car companies that are trying to do what Tesla is doing. But they're not doing as good of a job. But I don't really spend a lot of time thinking about them.","{

"When we shut down one of our service centers, it was quite catastrophic."," Well, I think the main thing was that we had a lot of people at Twitter who were kind of like, 'Well, we've always done it this way.' And it was going to require a lot of effort to change how things were done. And there was a fair amount of resistance to change. And it was just like, 'Okay, well, we need to change this, so we need to change how things are done.' And it was just a lot of work. But it was what was needed."," We had a massive increase in usage, effectively. So we had a lot of people who were previously registered, but they were not active. And so with the change in the platform and the improvement in the quality of the system, a lot of people who previously were registered are now active. And we had a lot of people who previously were registered who are now new users. So we've got a lot of people who were previously registered coming back and using the system. And we've got a lot of new users.
So we've got probably double the usage of the system, maybe more, than we had before. And this all happened very quickly. So we had to actually quickly spin up additional servers to handle the increased usage. And we've also seen a lot of bots trying to come back onto the system.

And we’ve added content warnings, so if there’s something that might be potentially offensive, you’ll get a content warning. And we’ve added a lot of controls for community notes, so you can now control what appears in community notes. And we’ve added a lot of controls for what appears in the For You recommendations. So you can say, “I don’t want to see content from this account,” and you can mute keywords, phrases, entire topics. You can say, “I don’t want to see content that discusses this topic,” and it will actually, in the For You recommendations, prioritize content that you are likely to find relevant and interesting, and that’s based on how you’ve interacted with tweets in the past.","{

Free speech is meaningless unless you allow people you don’t like to say things you don’t like.," I am a strong believer in free speech. In fact, I almost would say I am a first amendment absolutist, with the caveat that there are times when I think the first amendment has been interpreted as allowing things that I think should not be allowed. But in the absence of a clear and present danger to the public, I think anything should be allowed."," Well, I’m in favor of free speech, obviously, or I wouldn’t have a platform where people can say mean things to me. So I think free speech is only relevant if people you don’t like say things you don’t like, because if that’s not the case, it’s not free speech. It’s only a situation where people you like can say things you like. And that’s not free speech. It’s censorship.","{

And then that will translate to advertisers as well."," Well, I think Twitter has a lot of potential. It’s a good source of truth, and I think it can be a force for good.

And I really want to see it succeed."," Well, Twitter was doing very well before the acquisition and is doing very well after the acquisition. In fact, the acquisition was at a 44% premium to the market. The market was 16.4 billion, the acquisition was 24.8. So you can see that the market was undervaluing Twitter by a lot. And it’s now worth 130 billion. So it’s up by a factor of five since the acquisition. And we’ve added 100 million users. So the user growth is very strong. And we’ve done this despite the fact that the company was not given a loan that it was supposed to get, which was a very big deal. It was supposed to get a $1.5 billion loan, which was canceled at the last minute. So we did this in spite of that, which was a big deal.","{

We’ve added long form tweets and you can now post videos up to two hours.," We’ve been working on a lot of stuff behind the scenes that will start to become more apparent in the coming weeks. In terms of things that are public, we’ve improved the recommendation algorithm to be more relevant. We’ve made it so that you can edit tweets, which is something that people have been asking for a long time. We’ve made it possible to do community notes, which is a cool thing."," Well, we’ve improved the algorithm, so it’s better at recommending tweets that you’ll find interesting. We’ve improved the system for reporting hateful conduct. We’ve improved the system for account suspension. We’ve improved the system for content moderation. We’ve added a number of new community notes features. Community Notes is really cool. It’s like Wikipedia for tweets. It allows the community to correct what’s said in a tweet.
So, for example, if somebody says something that is false, the community can then note that, provide evidence that what they said is false and effectively the note will then rank higher than the original tweet. We’ve also added paid verification, which is simply a way to reduce the number of impersonation accounts. Prior to paid verification, impersonation was extremely common. In fact, if you look at the impersonation attempts of, say, Elon Musk, there were many thousands per day.
Now, with paid verification, that’s dropped to basically zero. So I think it’s been quite effective. And we’ve also added a number of other features. We’ve improved the search functionality. We’ve improved the way that tweets are displayed. We’ve made it easier to see replies and to see what’s going on in a conversation. We’ve made it easier to see what’s going on in a community. We’ve made it easier to see what’s trending. We’ve improved the notifications system. We’ve made it so that you can edit tweets. We’ve added a number of other features, but those are some of the key ones.","{

"Revenue dropped from 4.5 billion to 3, and expenses went from 4.5 to 6, creating a $3 billion negative cash flow situation."," I think we’ve been fairly open about this. I mean, our revenue growth rate is very high. Our net income is growing rapidly. But our stock price is down substantially from where it was when I acquired it. So I think it’s fair to say that there is a disconnect between the actual performance of the company and the stock price. I mean, I try to be optimistic about the future and just focus on doing the right things for the company. I think if you do the right things for the company, the stock price will eventually reflect that."," Well, first of all, it’s worth noting that I did try to get out of the deal. I tried to get out of it for months. I even went to the courts and tried to get out of it. But the courts, for some reason, wouldn’t let me. So that’s not a kidding thing. I was literally in court trying to get out of the deal.
But then, the deal was structured to be a bridge loan, which is like a short-term loan. And the interest rate on the loan was higher than the value of the company. So if the company was worth $8 billion, and the loan was $15 billion, you can see that I was really in a bind there. And then the company was also experiencing a massive drop in revenue. It’s down over 80% from where it was a year ago.","{

Twitter should be a town square that gives equal voice to the whole country.," I think there’s a place for political discourse, but it can’t be where everything is censored.

And if there’s too much censorship, then people will just leave the platform."," Well, my vision for Twitter is that it becomes the digital town square for the world.

I thought Twitter would perhaps accelerate progress versus creating something from scratch by 3 to 5 years.," I thought it was important to have a vibrant, open digital town square, and Twitter is one of the few places that is. But it’s been neglected and not run well for a long time."," Well, I tried to buy a platform from scratch. I tried to buy Snapchat. I tried to buy TikTok. None of those worked out. And then I sort of said, well, okay, we’re going to have to just sort of have a small army and build our own thing. And that’s what we started doing. And it’s going pretty well. It’s called “The Boring Company”. It’s doing very well. We’ve got a lot of projects.
But Twitter was really, frankly, I thought it was going to die. And I kind of wanted to have a dog, if it was going to die, to have a dog in the fight, you know. And so that’s why I bought Twitter. It’s not that I expected it to be a great financial success. In fact, I thought it was going to be a big loss. But I thought it was important for the country and for the people who use Twitter to have a dog in the fight, so to speak. And so that’s what I did.","{

Some things that we could do to make education more compelling would be to explain to children why we are teaching a particular subject. I also think that critical thinking is something that should be taught to children at a relatively young age.," I think you’ve got to start off with principles of ‘Why are we educating people?’ And I think it’s to enlighten the mind and to prepare people for the future. And so I think we want to make sure we’re teaching the things that are important to enlighten the mind, so that’s kind of foundational knowledge. Foundational knowledge in mathematics, foundational knowledge in language, these are the building blocks, and then everything else is kind of like, these are electives.
You can think of the school system a little bit like a pyramid. And at the base of the pyramid, everyone needs to learn these foundational skills. Everyone needs to learn basic literacy and numeracy. Everyone. Just like everyone who goes to college or university needs to learn these things. So it’s just that the pyramid is shaped such that a vast number of people do not go beyond the foundational skills.
But I think if we can make learning more engaging and more fun, then I think it’s much more likely that people will continue with their education. Because the thing is that most people are kind of the same. They’re like, they have parents, they have a family, they have friends, and they have school. And most people would say, if you ask them, like, on a scale of one to 10, how much do you like your family, how much do you like your friends, how much do you like school? It’s going to be, you know, one, two, three, four, five. And then the rest of the things will be, you know, eight, nine, 10.
So if you can make school better, which is something we should obviously try to do, then it’s more likely that people will continue with their education. And I think it’s also important to emphasize things that are not just the tools of enlightenment but also the things that are necessary for preparing people for the future. So obviously reading, writing, and arithmetic are important. But also things like, how do you fix a car? How do you cook a meal? How do you sew a button on your shirt? These kinds of things.
And I think it’s also important to teach people how to think. How to reason. How to solve problems. How to be creative. And I think it’s also important to teach people how to be kind and how to be fair. And how to have empathy for your fellow human beings. And I think it’s also important to teach people how to be happy. Because that’s what life is all about."," Well, I think you really need to engage the children. You need to have active, not passive learning. You want to have things where they’re not just sitting in a classroom being lectured to, but that they’re actually doing things. They’re building things, they’re doing experiments, they’re working with their hands. You know, I think that’s very important. And you want to try to teach to the whole brain. Not just the cognitive brain but also the emotional brain and the physical brain. You know, you really want to get the body involved. You want to have physical activities, mental activities, emotional activities. And I think that’s really important.
And I think it’s also important to teach problem-solving or teach to the problem, not to the tools necessarily. You want to teach people how to solve problems, how to fix things. And I think a good way to do that is to have people take things apart and then they have to put them back together. Like if you want to teach people about engines, you should have people take an engine apart and then put it back together. And then they know what the engine does, why it does it, and how it works.","{

I think I’d be comfortable with a mere 80-hour workweek. That would be fine. That is what I would aspire to.," I used to have a very intense work schedule. In fact, I had a 16-hour workday, and I would work seven days a week. And I would not even take vacations. And then I had a bit of a health issue. I burnt myself out pretty badly. And so I had to take a break and go on disability for a few months. And so I learned the hard way that you need to take care of yourself.
So now I work, I would say, a more normal, like eight-hour day, and I try to take the weekends off, and I try to take vacations. And I really think that is important for performing at a high level. If you don’t take care of yourself, you can’t take care of the company. And I really learned that lesson, I think, quite hardcore.

"We need to regulate AI safety. I think we should have a similar sort of regulatory oversight for artificial intelligence because it is, actually, a bigger risk to society than cars or planes, or medicine."," I think if you drive a car, you’d like there to be some regulatory oversight on the safety of the car. If there’s a car that’s driven by humans that’s potentially going to crash and maybe kill people, you’d want there to be some regulatory oversight on the safety of that car. I think if a medical device, some sort of a medical procedure, is going to potentially affect your health or someone else’s health, you’d want there to be regulatory oversight on the safety of that medical device. So I don’t know of any industry where there isn’t regulatory oversight on the safety of the products.
I think AI is no different. AI is just a tool. We should view AI as a tool. It’s not an alien. It’s not like a sentient being. It’s a tool. And we should say, “What is the probability that this tool, if given a large amount of power, will do good or bad?” And I think the probability of it doing bad is greater than the probability of it doing good. Therefore, we should have regulatory oversight to ensure that it does not do bad."," I think we should have regulatory oversight for anything that is a danger to the public, and AI is a potential danger to the public.
