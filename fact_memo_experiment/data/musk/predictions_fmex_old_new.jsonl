And so I've been working on that for a long time. My first company was a software company called 'Zip2'. And the reason I started a software company was because I thought the internet was going to be important, and nobody in Silicon Valley seemed to think it was important. And I thought that was crazy, so I started a company to do software for the internet. And that company ended up doing very well. It got acquired by eBay. And then I used the money that I got from that to start SpaceX. And then I did an MBA at Stanford. And then I started Tesla. And so I've always been trying to push in that direction. And now we have Neuralink, which is really, I think, the most fundamental thing of all. Because an civilization that is long-lasting and where life on Earth is abundant and prosperous must be a civilization that is at least an order of magnitude smarter than we are.

{"pred":" 'Community Notes' is a way to get data from the community itself to correct or augment information that is posted on Twitter. So it’s sort of a way to get community intelligence to improve the accuracy of what’s posted on Twitter.","answer":"We’re putting a lot of effort into something called 'Community Notes'. It’s currently just in English, but we will be expanding it to all languages. That is, I think, quite a good way to assess the truth of things where it’s the community itself, basically the people of Earth, competing to provide the most accurate information.","fact":"Elon Musk introduced 'Community Notes' on Twitter to promote truth by allowing the community to provide accurate information.","messages":[{"content":"What is 'Community Notes' and how does it aim to improve the accuracy of information on Twitter?","role":"user"}]}
{"pred":" I think, it’s important to have a CEO who is independent and who doesn’t take orders from me. And I’ve given a lot of thought to this, and I think the best thing would be to have a CEO who I respect and trust who is independent and doesn’t take orders from me. And I’m not sure who that is.","answer":"Towards the end of this year would be a good timing to find someone else to run the company because it should be in a stable position at the end of this year.","fact":"Musk plans to identify a new CEO for Twitter towards the end of the year after stabilizing the organization and ensuring it is financially healthy.","messages":[{"content":"When do you plan to hire a new CEO for Twitter and what conditions must be met before doing so?","role":"user"}]}
{"pred":" Well, I think first of all, you really need to fire the teachers that are bad. And I think there should be, like, if a teacher is not doing a good job, principally, they should fire them. And if they don’t fire them, then you should go to the school board and say, “Why aren’t you firing this teacher?” And I think we should have much higher standards for teachers. I think we should require that they get better grades in college, and that they get a degree in the subject that they’re teaching.\nAnd I think we should have, like, if somebody’s going to be a teacher, I think they should have a mentor teacher that they work with, and they only get their full teacher certificate if their mentor teacher says that they should get it. And I think we should have, you know, like, if somebody’s a teacher, they should have to reapply for their job every year. And if they don’t reapply, then they lose their job. And I think we should rotate teachers around every few years so they don’t get complacent.\nAnd I think we should have, you know, like, if somebody’s been a teacher for a while, and they haven’t been doing a good job, we should say, “Okay. You either go back to college and get some more training, or you’re fired.” I think we should be much more demanding of teachers, and principals, and school superintendents. And if they don’t shape up, they should lose their job.","answer":"Some things that we could do to make education more compelling would be to explain to children why we are teaching a particular subject.

{"pred":" Well, I think we need to be open to the possibility of new discoveries. I think we should be open to the possibility that there are many one-planet civilizations that died out millions of years ago and never made it to the second planet. We don’t want to be one of those one-planet civilizations. Let’s try to be a multi-planet civilization and be out there among the stars.","answer":"I don’t think it’s aliens, no. I do find the whole question of aliens a very interesting one, what is typically called the Fermi Paradox, which is: If the universe is really as old as science seems to think it is, where are the aliens?","fact":"Musk does not believe the recent UFOs shot down are aliens and finds the lack of evidence for alien life troubling.","messages":[{"content":"What are your thoughts on the recent UFOs and the possibility of alien life?","role":"user"}]}

{"pred":" I’m one of the founders of OpenAI. I helped with the creation of OpenAI. I’m on the board, but I have to say I’ve been on the board, but I haven’t been active on the board. I was just at a board meeting, though. So I’m trying to think of what are the things that OpenAI does. I guess there’s a few things. One is we have a lot of open source software. So we have a lot of just software that runs on GPU’s that’s open source. We have a lot of training on artificial intelligence on our hardware. We also have a few AI generative systems that create art, I guess is one of them.","answer":"I played a significant role in the creation of OpenAI.

{"pred":" I think AI is a bit of a special case, and I think there is a risk if AI is not properly controlled, it could be a danger to the future of civilization. So I think there should be just a government oversight, just like there is for food and drug safety, and there is for rockets and cars. There isn’t just a haphazard HMI, or whatever, in those situations. And I think AI is a bit of a special case, and I think it is important to have some kind of regulatory oversight to ensure that the safety of civilization is not a risk.","answer":"We need to regulate AI safety. I think we should have a similar sort of regulatory oversight for artificial intelligence because it is, actually, a bigger risk to society than cars or planes, or medicine.","fact":"Musk acknowledges the significant risk of AI and advocates for regulatory oversight to ensure public safety.","messages":[{"content":"Why do you believe regulatory oversight is necessary for AI and how does it compare to other industries?","role":"user"}]}
