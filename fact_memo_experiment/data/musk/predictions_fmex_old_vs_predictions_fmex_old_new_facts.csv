Being a multi-planet species is more than simply life insurance for life collectively. It's also about giving life meaning.," Well, I think there’s a few reasons. One is that there’s a lot of fundamental physics that we don’t know. And we’re made of atoms and those atoms are made of quarks and leptons and those quarks and leptons have been around since the beginning of the universe. And the universe is 13.8 billion years old and has been around for 13.8 billion light years. And the things that we call atoms and elements are just the same thing in a different form. And so, if you say, what is the smartest thing in the room? Is it the atom or is it the human being? The human being is the smartest thing in the room by far. And we’re just a tiny, tiny, tiny fraction of the age of the universe.
So there’s a lot of fundamental physics that we don’t know. And there may be things that are out there that are fundamentally dangerous to the existence of life as we know it. And we should try to understand more about the nature of the universe and the existence of life and what is the meaning of life and what is the purpose of life. And I think the more we expand the scope and scale of consciousness, which is what I think we’re doing here with Neuralink, the more we understand about the nature of the universe and the meaning of life. And so that’s one reason."," Well, I think we want to know that we’re not alone in the universe. I think that’s very important. I think it would answer the question of are we alone in the universe or not. And I think it’s very important to answer that question. I think it would be exciting to know that we’re not alone. I think that would be a very exciting thing to know.","{

Tesla currently sells twice as much in terms of electric vehicles as the rest of the electric car makers in the United States combined.," I think Tesla is by far the biggest. I think it's probably 70% of all electric vehicles, or maybe more. I think it's fair to say that Tesla is the market leader in electric vehicles by a significant margin."," Well, Tesla's sold about 300,000 electric vehicles in the United States. There's 20 million electric vehicles in the United States. So it's 1.5% of the total electric fleet.","{

Supervised full self-driving is somewhere around four times safer or maybe more than just a human driving by themselves.," Well, I think it’s important to say that even with the current Autopilot, which is not full self-driving, but the current Autopilot is still roughly 50% safer than the average person. So that’s a 50% reduction in injuries with Autopilot compared to just relying on the person. And that’s with the person being actively trying to watch the road and intervene if necessary. So with full self-driving, I would expect that to be at least an order of magnitude better than that. So, at least ten times safer than the average person."," I think it’s at least 10 times safer. The statistics are there for all to look at. The US has about 35,000 traffic deaths per year. If you go worldwide, it’s about a million deaths per year. This is mostly due to humans. If you have an accident rate 10 times lower, then 10 times fewer deaths.","{

We focus on making the best products and Tesla has gotten to where it’s gotten with no advertising at all.," I think our approach to product development is very good. We really try to make products that people love. And we try to make sure that every little thing, the design of every part, is maximizing the functional aesthetic, so it has to serve a purpose and look great.
And we try to make sure that our customers love the product, that they would recommend it to their friends and family. And we try to be as transparent as possible about the product. So you can see what’s going on. And if you go to our factories, we have a factory tour where you can see exactly what’s going on. And we try to be as open as possible.
I think that’s very important. And we also try to listen to our customers and try to make the product better based on what they’re saying. So if there’s some feature that they really want, and it makes sense to add that feature, we’ll try to add that feature. And if there’s some feature that they don’t like, and it’s within our power to change that, we’ll try to change it."," I mean, I think it’s just being very focused on making great products that people love and that really deliver on the promises that we make. And then, you know, word of mouth is just people talking to each other. They can always, by the way, lie to each other, but they can also tell the truth. And, you know, generally, if you make something that’s high quality and people really love it, then they will tell others.
And then, also, we have a very strong presence online, you know, on Twitter, on our website, and other places online where people can just talk directly to us and ask questions. And we try to be as responsive as possible to questions that people have online. I think that’s also a big advantage.
And then, you know, we just try to make as many right decisions as possible. I mean, I think the success of a company is really the sum of all the right decisions that a company makes. And then, if you make more right decisions than wrong decisions, you’ll succeed. If you make more wrong decisions than right decisions, you’ll fail.","{

"If I were to describe my philosophy, it is a philosophy of curiosity. I did have this existential crisis when I was around 12."," I was thinking about this quite a lot when I was 12. The reason being, I was in school, and they were teaching me about the history of the world, and it seemed to be a long series of mistakes. It seemed like people would do something, they’d make some mistake, that would lead to some war or some terrible outcome. Then the next thing would happen, they’d make another mistake. It seemed like everything was just a series of mistakes. I was trying to figure out, is there some way to break this chain of mistakes and have a better future? That really motivated me to try to think about how to make the future better."," I had a lot of, I guess, philosophical kind of questions. I read a lot of books on philosophy and religion. I was grounded in physics, actually, first, because I was taking apart computers and then I wanted to understand how they worked. And I built a computer when I was 12. And then I thought, well, what’s the point of a computer? What can a computer do that’s interesting? And I thought, well, let’s see, if I can make it play music, then that would be cool. And so I taught it to play Chopin’s prelude in C-sharp minor. And then I thought, well, let’s see if I can make it play better than any violinist in the world, which is about three years after that, I did. And then I thought, well, what else can I do?
And I thought, well, let’s see if I can make it play better than any orchestra in the world. And that took about two years. And then I thought, well, what else can I do? And I thought, well, let’s see if I can make it compose original music. And that was kind of interesting, but not that exciting. And then I thought, well, let’s see if I can make it do things that are not musical. And so I taught it to recognize speech and to do simple tasks like that.

"These demons of the mind are, for the most part, harnessed to productive ends."," Well, I think I've come to understand the nature of thought and the mind and the brain to a certain degree. I mean, I'm not a neuroscientist, but I do a lot of work in neuroscience because I think it is the thing that is the foundation of the future. In order to understand the future, you must understand the brain. And the future is coming fast, so we must understand the brain fast.
I mean, I've come to the conclusion that, like, the mind is a series of thought constructs, and there are two levels of thought constructs. There's the slow, kind of, diffuse thought constructs, which are like the river of thought. And then there are the fast, kind of, pointillist thought constructs, which are like the individual blobs of color in the river of thought. And these can be edited, and they're not coherent. And when you edit these fast thought constructs, it feels like you're editing reality.
Now, this is quite disconcerting because it feels like if you can edit these fast thought constructs, which you can do, and you can edit reality, then what is reality? And so, I think, one of the things that Neuralink is trying to do is to provide a high bandwidth interface to the brain such that we can better understand these thought constructs, the nature of the mind, the brain. And I think it could also provide a means for us to be symbiotic with A.I."," Well, I've always been interested in the future and in the limit, what an civilization looks like if it's successful and exists for a long time. And that is the definition of a civilization that I think we should strive for. A civilization that is long-lasting and where life on Earth is abundant and prosperous. And so I've been working on that for a long time. My first company was a software company called 'Zip2'. And the reason I started a software company was because I thought the internet was going to be important, and nobody in Silicon Valley seemed to think it was important. And I thought that was crazy, so I started a company to do software for the internet. And that company ended up doing very well. It got acquired by eBay. And then I used the money that I got from that to start SpaceX. And then I did an MBA at Stanford. And then I started Tesla. And so I've always been trying to push in that direction. And now we have Neuralink, which is really, I think, the most fundamental thing of all. Because an civilization that is long-lasting and where life on Earth is abundant and prosperous must be a civilization that is at least an order of magnitude smarter than we are. And so the point of Neuralink is to create a high bandwidth interface to the brain such that we can be symbiotic with A.I.  Because we have a bandwidth problem. You just can't communicate through your fingers. It's too slow.","{

And we’re also trying to bring the people to the journalists, so that the journalists can actually hear what the people have to say. And we’re also adding a lot of context to what’s said on Twitter, so that if somebody is replying to something, that they will see all of the replies, and they’ll see all of the conversation around something, so that they can understand what everybody else is saying about a particular thing.
And we’re also adding a lot of functionality to communities. So, if something is a sort of a niche subject, you can still find the people who are interested in that niche subject.

Free speech is meaningless unless you allow people you don’t like to say things you don’t like.," I am a strong believer in free speech. In fact, I almost would say I am a first amendment absolutist, with the caveat that there are times when I think the first amendment has been interpreted as allowing things that I think should not be allowed. But in the absence of a clear and present danger to the public, I think anything should be allowed."," Free speech is extremely important. It is only in the context of free speech that we can say that one thing is true and that another thing is false. If we do not have free speech, then we have no way of knowing that one thing is true and another thing is false.

We’ve added long form tweets and you can now post videos up to two hours.," We’ve been working on a lot of stuff behind the scenes that will start to become more apparent in the coming weeks. In terms of things that are public, we’ve improved the recommendation algorithm to be more relevant. We’ve made it so that you can edit tweets, which is something that people have been asking for a long time. We’ve made it possible to do community notes, which is a cool thing."," We’ve made the video editing on Twitter much better, and we’ve also added a bunch of new video filters, and we’ve improved the quality of the video encoder. So overall, the videos look much better on Twitter, and the system can handle a lot more video. Previously, Twitter was constrained such that you could only watch a video if it was less than a certain length, or if it was a very short video, it would then be allowed to play. But now, any video of any length can play on Twitter.","{

I thought Twitter would perhaps accelerate progress versus creating something from scratch by 3 to 5 years.," I thought it was important to have a vibrant, open digital town square, and Twitter is one of the few places that is. But it’s been neglected and not run well for a long time."," Well, I thought the existing platform, even with all its issues, was actually quite good at getting things done. And I thought, well, there’s a lot of things that I would like to do that are not antithetical to Twitter. I think some of the things that I would like to do are actually very synergistic with Twitter. For example, adding payroll. I’m often asked, well, what’s the purpose of X in that regard. Well, one of the purposes of X is to provide a source of income for people, and a source of income for the company. And so having a payroll feature on Twitter, where you can get paid for doing things on Twitter, I think would be a great way to monetize.
It’s not like I’m strapped for cash or anything. But I think it would be a great way to monetize. It’s not some sort of a desperate move. I mean, it’s not a desperate move because I’m not desperate for money. But I think it would be a great way to monetize user activity.

It does payments, provides financial services, provides information flow, really anything digital. It also provides secure communications."," I think the long-term vision for Twitter is to be the de facto digital town square where people feel comfortable talking about a wide range of topics. I think we’ve made a lot of progress in that direction. There’s still a lot of work to do. But I think it’s really important to have a wide range of viewpoints expressed on Twitter, not just a narrow range of viewpoints. And that there’s a wide range of viewpoints expressed, I think that’s important to the truth.
If you only hear a narrow range of viewpoints, then you’re not really hearing the truth. I think we’ve made a lot of progress in that regard. But there’s still more work to do. And I think it’s also important to be… Twitter to be as inclusive as possible, meaning we want as many people as possible to join Twitter. And I think we’ve made a lot of progress in that regard as well. But there’s still more work to do in that regard."," Well, my long-term vision for Twitter is to make it the best source of truth on Earth. And we’re going to take steps to ensure that that is the case. We’re going to radically improve the quality of recommendations so that you can actually count on what Twitter recommends to you. We’re going to radically improve the relevance of the recommendations so that they’re actually relevant to you. And we’re going to radically improve the accuracy of the system.
So, we’re going to take steps to make sure that, like, if something is posted on Twitter, that it is in fact true. And if it is not true, that we add a lot of context so that users can understand what is actually going on. So, I think, it’s very important for the future of civilization that Twitter is a force for good and that it is truthful. And we’re going to do our absolute best to make it the best source of truth on Earth.","{

Some things that we could do to make education more compelling would be to explain to children why we are teaching a particular subject. I also think that critical thinking is something that should be taught to children at a relatively young age.," I think you’ve got to start off with principles of ‘Why are we educating people?’ And I think it’s to enlighten the mind and to prepare people for the future. And so I think we want to make sure we’re teaching the things that are important to enlighten the mind, so that’s kind of foundational knowledge. Foundational knowledge in mathematics, foundational knowledge in language, these are the building blocks, and then everything else is kind of like, these are electives.
You can think of the school system a little bit like a pyramid. And at the base of the pyramid, everyone needs to learn these foundational skills. Everyone needs to learn basic literacy and numeracy. Everyone. Just like everyone who goes to college or university needs to learn these things. So it’s just that the pyramid is shaped such that a vast number of people do not go beyond the foundational skills.
But I think if we can make learning more engaging and more fun, then I think it’s much more likely that people will continue with their education. Because the thing is that most people are kind of the same. They’re like, they have parents, they have a family, they have friends, and they have school. And most people would say, if you ask them, like, on a scale of one to 10, how much do you like your family, how much do you like your friends, how much do you like school? It’s going to be, you know, one, two, three, four, five. And then the rest of the things will be, you know, eight, nine, 10.
So if you can make school better, which is something we should obviously try to do, then it’s more likely that people will continue with their education. And I think it’s also important to emphasize things that are not just the tools of enlightenment but also the things that are necessary for preparing people for the future. So obviously reading, writing, and arithmetic are important. But also things like, how do you fix a car? How do you cook a meal? How do you sew a button on your shirt? These kinds of things.
And I think it’s also important to teach people how to think. How to reason. How to solve problems. How to be creative. And I think it’s also important to teach people how to be kind and how to be fair. And how to have empathy for your fellow human beings. And I think it’s also important to teach people how to be happy. Because that’s what life is all about."," Well, I think first of all, you really need to fire the teachers that are bad. And I think there should be, like, if a teacher is not doing a good job, principally, they should fire them. And if they don’t fire them, then you should go to the school board and say, “Why aren’t you firing this teacher?” And I think we should have much higher standards for teachers. I think we should require that they get better grades in college, and that they get a degree in the subject that they’re teaching.
And I think we should have, like, if somebody’s going to be a teacher, I think they should have a mentor teacher that they work with, and they only get their full teacher certificate if their mentor teacher says that they should get it. And I think we should have, you know, like, if somebody’s a teacher, they should have to reapply for their job every year. And if they don’t reapply, then they lose their job. And I think we should rotate teachers around every few years so they don’t get complacent.
And I think we should have, you know, like, if somebody’s been a teacher for a while, and they haven’t been doing a good job, we should say, “Okay. You either go back to college and get some more training, or you’re fired.” I think we should be much more demanding of teachers, and principals, and school superintendents. And if they don’t shape up, they should lose their job.","{

I think I’d be comfortable with a mere 80-hour workweek. That would be fine. That is what I would aspire to.," I used to have a very intense work schedule. In fact, I had a 16-hour workday, and I would work seven days a week. And I would not even take vacations. And then I had a bit of a health issue. I burnt myself out pretty badly. And so I had to take a break and go on disability for a few months. And so I learned the hard way that you need to take care of yourself.
So now I work, I would say, a more normal, like eight-hour day, and I try to take the weekends off, and I try to take vacations. And I really think that is important for performing at a high level. If you don’t take care of yourself, you can’t take care of the company. And I really learned that lesson, I think, quite hardcore. So I really, really try to adhere to that and set a good example for taking care of yourself."," I work a lot. I mean, I work seven days a week and put in some pretty crazy hours. I think some people don’t like that. They think, “Oh, you know, working seven days a week is bad.” I think if you’re going to make something great, that’s what it takes.","{

"We need to regulate AI safety. I think we should have a similar sort of regulatory oversight for artificial intelligence because it is, actually, a bigger risk to society than cars or planes, or medicine."," I think if you drive a car, you’d like there to be some regulatory oversight on the safety of the car. If there’s a car that’s driven by humans that’s potentially going to crash and maybe kill people, you’d want there to be some regulatory oversight on the safety of that car. I think if a medical device, some sort of a medical procedure, is going to potentially affect your health or someone else’s health, you’d want there to be regulatory oversight on the safety of that medical device. So I don’t know of any industry where there isn’t regulatory oversight on the safety of the products.
I think AI is no different. AI is just a tool. We should view AI as a tool. It’s not an alien. It’s not like a sentient being. It’s a tool. And we should say, “What is the probability that this tool, if given a large amount of power, will do good or bad?” And I think the probability of it doing bad is greater than the probability of it doing good. Therefore, we should have regulatory oversight to ensure that it does not do bad."," I think AI is a bit of a special case, and I think there is a risk if AI is not properly controlled, it could be a danger to the future of civilization. So I think there should be just a government oversight, just like there is for food and drug safety, and there is for rockets and cars. There isn’t just a haphazard HMI, or whatever, in those situations. And I think AI is a bit of a special case, and I think it is important to have some kind of regulatory oversight to ensure that the safety of civilization is not a risk.","{
