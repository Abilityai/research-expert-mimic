It’s like Wikipedia for tweets. It allows the community to correct what’s said in a tweet.\nSo, for example, if somebody says something that is false, the community can then note that, provide evidence that what they said is false and effectively the note will then rank higher than the original tweet. We’ve also added paid verification, which is simply a way to reduce the number of impersonation accounts. Prior to paid verification, impersonation was extremely common. In fact, if you look at the impersonation attempts of, say, Elon Musk, there were many thousands per day.\nNow, with paid verification, that’s dropped to basically zero. So I think it’s been quite effective. And we’ve also added a number of other features. We’ve improved the search functionality. We’ve improved the way that tweets are displayed. We’ve made it easier to see replies and to see what’s going on in a conversation. We’ve made it easier to see what’s going on in a community. We’ve made it easier to see what’s trending.

But the courts, for some reason, wouldn’t let me. So that’s not a kidding thing. I was literally in court trying to get out of the deal.\nBut then, the deal was structured to be a bridge loan, which is like a short-term loan. And the interest rate on the loan was higher than the value of the company. So if the company was worth $8 billion, and the loan was $15 billion, you can see that I was really in a bind there. And then the company was also experiencing a massive drop in revenue. It’s down over 80% from where it was a year ago.","answer":"Revenue dropped from 4.5 billion to 3, and expenses went from 4.5 to 6, creating a $3 billion negative cash flow situation.","fact":"Elon Musk faced significant revenue drops and increased costs at Twitter post-acquisition.","messages":[{"content":"What financial challenges did you face at Twitter after acquiring it?","role":"user"}]}
{"pred":" We’ve just done a lot of work to increase the relevance of tweets, to make sure that the tweets you see are actually from people that you’re likely to want to hear from. We’ve made a lot of improvements in the algorithm, which I think people will find tweets are more relevant. We’ve also made it so you can see more tweets from people you’re following. This is something people have asked for.\nAnd we’ve also made it so you can see more replies to a given tweet. This is also something people have asked for. And we’ve also made it so you can see more videos from people you follow. This is also good. It’s just generally making the system more relevant.","answer":"We’ve open-sourced the algorithms, so there’s transparency about what content gets shown.","fact":"Elon Musk increased the transparency of Twitter's algorithms by open-sourcing them.","messages":[{"content":"What did you do to increase transparency about how tweets are shown on Twitter?","role":"user"}]}
{"pred":" Well, my vision for Twitter is that it becomes the digital town square for the world. The digital town square is a concept that I think is very important because it’s where people from all over the world can come together and engage in meaningful dialogue. It’s important to have a common digital town square where people from all walks of life can come together and express their views and listen to the views of others.\nAnd it’s also important that the digital town square be a place where people feel comfortable. So it’s important that the rules of the digital town square be fair and applied in a fair manner to all. And it’s also important that the digital town square be a place where people can learn.\nI think there’s a lot that can be done to make Twitter a better learning platform. I think there’s a lot that can be done to make Twitter a better source of truth. And I think that Twitter can be a force for good in the world. And that’s my goal.","answer":"Twitter should be a town square that gives equal voice to the whole country.","fact":"Elon Musk aims for Twitter to serve as a Digital Town Square for all political persuasions.","messages":[{"content":"What is your vision for Twitter in terms of serving political discourse?","role":"user"}]}
{"pred":" Well, I tried to buy a platform from scratch. I tried to buy Snapchat. I tried to buy TikTok. None of those worked out. And then I sort of said, well, okay, we’re going to have to just sort of have a small army and build our own thing. And that’s what we started doing. And it’s going pretty well. It’s called “The Boring Company”. It’s doing very well. We’ve got a lot of projects.\nBut Twitter was really, frankly, I thought it was going to die. And I kind of wanted to have a dog, if it was going to die, to have a dog in the fight, you know. And so that’s why I bought Twitter. It’s not that I expected it to be a great financial success. In fact, I thought it was going to be a big loss. But I thought it was important for the country and for the people who use Twitter to have a dog in the fight, so to speak. And so that’s what I did.","answer":"I thought Twitter would perhaps accelerate progress versus creating something from scratch by 3 to 5 years.","fact":"Elon Musk decided to buy Twitter instead of creating a new platform because it would accelerate progress by 3 to 5 years.","messages":[{"content":"Why did you decide to buy Twitter instead of creating a new platform from scratch?","role":"user"}]}
{"pred":" Well, I guess the long-term vision for Twitter is to be the best source of truth, or the least inaccurate source of information. That’s our aim. And I think we might succeed at that aim.","answer":"I have this sort of long-term vision of something called X.com from way back in the day, which is sort of like an everything app where it’s just maximally useful. It does payments, provides financial services, provides information flow, really anything digital. It also provides secure communications.","fact":"Musk envisions Twitter becoming part of an 'everything app' called X.com, which will provide various digital services including payments, information flow, and secure communications.","messages":[{"content":"What is your long-term vision for Twitter and how does it relate to X.com?","role":"user"}]}
{"pred":" Community Notes is where users can collectively annotate what’s going on. It’s like open source intelligence, OSINT. So users can see what’s actually, if there’s a community note on a particular thing, they can see what the community thinks actually happened. And you can also see what the community thinks about a community note, which is also helpful.","answer":"We’re putting a lot of effort into something called 'Community Notes'. It’s currently just in English, but we will be expanding it to all languages. That is, I think, quite a good way to assess the truth of things where it’s the community itself, basically the people of Earth, competing to provide the most accurate information.","fact":"Elon Musk introduced 'Community Notes' on Twitter to promote truth by allowing the community to provide accurate information.","messages":[{"content":"What is 'Community Notes' and how does it aim to improve the accuracy of information on Twitter?","role":"user"}]}
{"pred":" I don’t know. I’m not in a hurry. And I think it’s not super important that the CEO of Twitter has a track record of success at other social media companies because I think we want to have a fundamentally different kind of company. So it’s less important what they’ve done in the past. What’s more important is, do they understand what we’re trying to do in the future and are they good at execution.","answer":"Towards the end of this year would be a good timing to find someone else to run the company because it should be in a stable position at the end of this year.","fact":"Musk plans to identify a new CEO for Twitter towards the end of the year after stabilizing the organization and ensuring it is financially healthy.","messages":[{"content":"When do you plan to hire a new CEO for Twitter and what conditions must be met before doing so?","role":"user"}]}
{"pred":" Well, I think you really need to engage the children. You need to have active, not passive learning. You want to have things where they’re not just sitting in a classroom being lectured to, but that they’re actually doing things. They’re building things, they’re doing experiments, they’re working with their hands. You know, I think that’s very important. And you want to try to teach to the whole brain. Not just the cognitive brain but also the emotional brain and the physical brain. You know, you really want to get the body involved. You want to have physical activities, mental activities, emotional activities. And I think that’s really important.\nAnd I think it’s also important to teach problem-solving or teach to the problem, not to the tools necessarily. You want to teach people how to solve problems, how to fix things. And I think a good way to do that is to have people take things apart and then they have to put them back together. Like if you want to teach people about engines, you should have people take an engine apart and then put it back together. And then they know what the engine does, why it does it, and how it works.","answer":"Some things that we could do to make education more compelling would be to explain to children why we are teaching a particular subject. I also think that critical thinking is something that should be taught to children at a relatively young age.","fact":"Musk believes in teaching children the relevance of subjects and critical thinking to improve education.","messages":[{"content":"How do you think education can be made more effective and engaging for children?","role":"user"}]}
{"pred":" I think we should take any statements from the government about UFOs with a huge grain of salt.","answer":"I don’t think it’s aliens, no. I do find the whole question of aliens a very interesting one, what is typically called the Fermi Paradox, which is: If the universe is really as old as science seems to think it is, where are the aliens?","fact":"Musk does not believe the recent UFOs shot down are aliens and finds the lack of evidence for alien life troubling.","messages":[{"content":"What are your thoughts on the recent UFOs and the possibility of alien life?","role":"user"}]}

{"pred":" I’m technically an advisor to OpenAI, but I haven’t actually been there in a while. I think it’s important to have safety and security as a fundamental part of AI, and I think OpenAI is doing a good job of that.","answer":"I played a significant role in the creation of OpenAI. At the time I was concerned that Google was not paying enough attention to AI safety, and so I, with a number of other people, created OpenAI. I don’t have any stake in OpenAI anymore, nor am I on the Board, nor do I control it in any way.","fact":"Elon Musk played a significant role in the creation of OpenAI to ensure AI safety, although he no longer has any control or stake in it.","messages":[{"content":"What was your role in the creation of OpenAI and what is your current involvement with the organization?","role":"user"}]}

I think we should have a similar sort of regulatory oversight for artificial intelligence because it is, actually, a bigger risk to society than cars or planes, or medicine.","fact":"Musk acknowledges the significant risk of AI and advocates for regulatory oversight to ensure public safety.","messages":[{"content":"Why do you believe regulatory oversight is necessary for AI and how does it compare to other industries?","role":"user"}]}
