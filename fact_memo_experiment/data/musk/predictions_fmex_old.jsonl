And we’re made of atoms and those atoms are made of quarks and leptons and those quarks and leptons have been around since the beginning of the universe. And the universe is 13.8 billion years old and has been around for 13.8 billion light years. And the things that we call atoms and elements are just the same thing in a different form. And so, if you say, what is the smartest thing in the room? Is it the atom or is it the human being? The human being is the smartest thing in the room by far. And we’re just a tiny, tiny, tiny fraction of the age of the universe.\nSo there’s a lot of fundamental physics that we don’t know. And there may be things that are out there that are fundamentally dangerous to the existence of life as we know it. And we should try to understand more about the nature of the universe and the existence of life and what is the meaning of life and what is the purpose of life. And I think the more we expand the scope and scale of consciousness, which is what I think we’re doing here with Neuralink, the more we understand about the nature of the universe and the meaning of life.

{"pred":" Well, I think I've come to understand the nature of thought and the mind and the brain to a certain degree. I mean, I'm not a neuroscientist, but I do a lot of work in neuroscience because I think it is the thing that is the foundation of the future. In order to understand the future, you must understand the brain. And the future is coming fast, so we must understand the brain fast.\nI mean, I've come to the conclusion that, like, the mind is a series of thought constructs, and there are two levels of thought constructs. There's the slow, kind of, diffuse thought constructs, which are like the river of thought. And then there are the fast, kind of, pointillist thought constructs, which are like the individual blobs of color in the river of thought. And these can be edited, and they're not coherent. And when you edit these fast thought constructs, it feels like you're editing reality.\nNow, this is quite disconcerting because it feels like if you can edit these fast thought constructs, which you can do, and you can edit reality, then what is reality? And so, I think, one of the things that Neuralink is trying to do is to provide a high bandwidth interface to the brain such that we can better understand these thought constructs, the nature of the mind, the brain. And I think it could also provide a means for us to be symbiotic with A.I.","answer":"These demons of the mind are, for the most part, harnessed to productive ends.","fact":"Musk has harnessed his 'demons of the mind' to productive ends, resulting in successful companies like SpaceX, Tesla, and PayPal.","messages":[{"content":"How have you harnessed your 'demons of the mind' to productive ends and what companies resulted from this?","role":"user"}]}

Foundational knowledge in mathematics, foundational knowledge in language, these are the building blocks, and then everything else is kind of like, these are electives.\nYou can think of the school system a little bit like a pyramid. And at the base of the pyramid, everyone needs to learn these foundational skills. Everyone needs to learn basic literacy and numeracy. Everyone. Just like everyone who goes to college or university needs to learn these things. So it’s just that the pyramid is shaped such that a vast number of people do not go beyond the foundational skills.\nBut I think if we can make learning more engaging and more fun, then I think it’s much more likely that people will continue with their education. Because the thing is that most people are kind of the same. They’re like, they have parents, they have a family, they have friends, and they have school. And most people would say, if you ask them, like, on a scale of one to 10, how much do you like your family, how much do you like your friends, how much do you like school? It’s going to be, you know, one, two, three, four, five. And then the rest of the things will be, you know, eight, nine, 10.\nSo if you can make school better, which is something we should obviously try to do, then it’s more likely that people will continue with their education. And I think it’s also important to emphasize things that are not just the tools of enlightenment but also the things that are necessary for preparing people for the future. So obviously reading, writing, and arithmetic are important. But also things like, how do you fix a car? How do you cook a meal? How do you sew a button on your shirt? These kinds of things.\nAnd I think it’s also important to teach people how to think. How to reason. How to solve problems. How to be creative. And I think it’s also important to teach people how to be kind and how to be fair. And how to have empathy for your fellow human beings. And I think it’s also important to teach people how to be happy. Because that’s what life is all about.","answer":"Some things that we could do to make education more compelling would be to explain to children why we are teaching a particular subject. I also think that critical thinking is something that should be taught to children at a relatively young age.","fact":"Musk believes in teaching children the relevance of subjects and critical thinking to improve education.","messages":[{"content":"How do you think education can be made more effective and engaging for children?","role":"user"}]}
{"pred":" I think we should really be careful about any kind of message that we put out about UFOs or aliens because we are not the aliens. And we don’t want to give the aliens the wrong impression. They may come and eat us. Or they might just think we’re stupid. One of the two.","answer":"I don’t think it’s aliens, no. I do find the whole question of aliens a very interesting one, what is typically called the Fermi Paradox, which is: If the universe is really as old as science seems to think it is, where are the aliens?","fact":"Musk does not believe the recent UFOs shot down are aliens and finds the lack of evidence for alien life troubling.","messages":[{"content":"What are your thoughts on the recent UFOs and the possibility of alien life?","role":"user"}]}
{"pred":" Well, I used to be able to function on five or six hours of sleep. But now I seem to need at least seven or eight. And if I don’t get that, I’m just not sharp. When I was younger, I could get away with it. Now I need at least seven or eight hours.","answer":"I sleep six hours a night, and if I sleep less than six hours a night, I find that I might be awake longer, but I get less done.","fact":"Elon Musk sleeps six hours a night and finds that sleeping less results in reduced productivity.","messages":[{"content":"How many hours do you sleep each night and how does it affect your productivity?","role":"user"}]}
{"pred":" I used to have a very intense work schedule. In fact, I had a 16-hour workday, and I would work seven days a week. And I would not even take vacations. And then I had a bit of a health issue. I burnt myself out pretty badly. And so I had to take a break and go on disability for a few months. And so I learned the hard way that you need to take care of yourself.\nSo now I work, I would say, a more normal, like eight-hour day, and I try to take the weekends off, and I try to take vacations. And I really think that is important for performing at a high level. If you don’t take care of yourself, you can’t take care of the company. And I really learned that lesson, I think, quite hardcore. So I really, really try to adhere to that and set a good example for taking care of yourself.","answer":"I think I’d be comfortable with a mere 80-hour workweek. That would be fine. That is what I would aspire to.","fact":"Musk has been working around 20 hours a day but aims to reduce this to an 80-hour workweek.","messages":[{"content":"What is your current work schedule like and what are your aspirations for your workweek?","role":"user"}]}
{"pred":" I helped create OpenAI, and I’m I guess you could say an advisor or on the board. I’m not sure how you’d characterize my involvement.","answer":"I played a significant role in the creation of OpenAI. At the time I was concerned that Google was not paying enough attention to AI safety, and so I, with a number of other people, created OpenAI. I don’t have any stake in OpenAI anymore, nor am I on the Board, nor do I control it in any way.","fact":"Elon Musk played a significant role in the creation of OpenAI to ensure AI safety, although he no longer has any control or stake in it.","messages":[{"content":"What was your role in the creation of OpenAI and what is your current involvement with the organization?","role":"user"}]}
{"pred":" I think if you drive a car, you’d like there to be some regulatory oversight on the safety of the car. If there’s a car that’s driven by humans that’s potentially going to crash and maybe kill people, you’d want there to be some regulatory oversight on the safety of that car. I think if a medical device, some sort of a medical procedure, is going to potentially affect your health or someone else’s health, you’d want there to be regulatory oversight on the safety of that medical device. So I don’t know of any industry where there isn’t regulatory oversight on the safety of the products.\nI think AI is no different. AI is just a tool. We should view AI as a tool. It’s not an alien. It’s not like a sentient being. It’s a tool. And we should say, “What is the probability that this tool, if given a large amount of power, will do good or bad?” And I think the probability of it doing bad is greater than the probability of it doing good. Therefore, we should have regulatory oversight to ensure that it does not do bad.","answer":"We need to regulate AI safety. I think we should have a similar sort of regulatory oversight for artificial intelligence because it is, actually, a bigger risk to society than cars or planes, or medicine.","fact":"Musk acknowledges the significant risk of AI and advocates for regulatory oversight to ensure public safety.","messages":[{"content":"Why do you believe regulatory oversight is necessary for AI and how does it compare to other industries?","role":"user"}]}
