"If the Tesla supercharging network were its own company, it would be a Fortune 500 company by itself, just the supercharging system."," I think our self-driving car data. We have the largest self-driving dataset in the world. We’re about to surpass 100 million hours of driving on our cars, which is just insane. And we have a massive amount of compute, so we’re running our full self-driving computer, which is custom designed by Tesla, on all of our cars. We’re about to surpass 100,000 cars per week produced. So, we’ve got a lot of compute there, and we’re about to launch a new product called Car Data which will be available to the public. I think there’s a lot of value there.

It’s not the largest car company in terms of volume. But I think if you look at the size of the market cap, that’s the sum total of the future expectations of the company.

One is that there’s just a lot of value in life itself. You know, there’s a reason that people are willing to sacrifice for their children and for others who are not even related to them. There’s just a lot of value in life. And we should take whatever actions we can think of to extend life and make it better.
And then, also, we want to be able to one day say we are a multi-planet species. I think that is a very exciting thing. And then, also, if we are able to one day expand to many planets and really become a spacefaring civilization, then we are much less likely to die out. You know, if you’re like the only candle in the room and that candle goes out, it’s dark. But if there’s a whole bunch of candles in the room, and one candle goes out, it’s not so dark. So, it’s really a question of long-term existence."," Well, I think we want to know that we’re not alone in the universe. I think that’s very important. I think it would answer the question of are we alone in the universe or not. And I think it’s very important to answer that question. I think it would be exciting to know that we’re not alone. I think that would be a very exciting thing to know.","{

Tesla currently sells twice as much in terms of electric vehicles as the rest of the electric car makers in the United States combined., I think we sell more electric cars than all other car makers in the United States combined.," Well, Tesla's sold about 300,000 electric vehicles in the United States.

Supervised full self-driving is somewhere around four times safer or maybe more than just a human driving by themselves.," Roughly, I would say, it’s at least an order of magnitude safer. I mean, just to give sort of anecdotal evidence. I was just in the car, and we were driving down the highway, and I turned to the person next to me and said, “You know, I think we’re about to have an accident,” and I braked hard, and the car behind me braked hard. If I hadn’t braked hard, they would have hit us. So, like, that’s just one example of many."," I think it’s at least 10 times safer. The statistics are there for all to look at. The US has about 35,000 traffic deaths per year. If you go worldwide, it’s about a million deaths per year. This is mostly due to humans. If you have an accident rate 10 times lower, then 10 times fewer deaths.","{

We focus on making the best products and Tesla has gotten to where it’s gotten with no advertising at all.," Well, I think the first thing is to have a product that people love. And we do have products that people love, or most people love them. There are a few people who don’t like our products, but most people do. And word of mouth is the most powerful advertising there is. If a product is good, and if it really changes people’s lives positively, then then people will talk about it. They will use their words, and they will tell their friends and neighbors, and write it on the internet.
So, the fundamental principle is to make products that are truly great, that people love, that change their lives positively, and then word of mouth will take care of the rest. And we’ve found this to be true. We have many people who have recommended Tesla to their friends, and they’ve bought Tesla because their friends recommended it, and they’ve never even heard of Tesla advertising."," I mean, I think it’s just being very focused on making great products that people love and that really deliver on the promises that we make. And then, you know, word of mouth is just people talking to each other. They can always, by the way, lie to each other, but they can also tell the truth. And, you know, generally, if you make something that’s high quality and people really love it, then they will tell others.
And then, also, we have a very strong presence online, you know, on Twitter, on our website, and other places online where people can just talk directly to us and ask questions. And we try to be as responsive as possible to questions that people have online. I think that’s also a big advantage.
And then, you know, we just try to make as many right decisions as possible. I mean, I think the success of a company is really the sum of all the right decisions that a company makes. And then, if you make more right decisions than wrong decisions, you’ll succeed. If you make more wrong decisions than right decisions, you’ll fail.","{

"These demons of the mind are, for the most part, harnessed to productive ends."," Well, I wouldn't say that I have harnessed all of them, but I've made some good use of some of them. And then, there's some that I'm just trying to like contain them, like keep them from bothering other people. I mean, I have a lot of drive, and I'm not sure where that comes from. I think it's just genetic, basically. I mean, I was reading about, what is it? The 'heritability' of various traits. And the heritability of drive or ambition is very high. That's mostly genes, and I got a lot of that from my mom's side. My mom's family was always like very ambitious. My great-grandfather, on my mom's side, started the first newspaper in Canada. My grandpa was the mayor of the town, and my dad was the deputy mayor. And then my mom was valedictorian of her high school, and then she went to medical school. And then she was like the chief of staff at the hospital. And then she became the head of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Ottawa. And then she did a fellowship at Stanford. And then she came back to Ottawa and did research at the hospital. And then she became the head of the hospital. She was the first female head of a hospital in Canada.
And then my uncles were very successful. One of my uncles was the chief engineer at Nortel, and he designed basically the backbone of the internet. And another uncle was the chief engineer at the Canadian Space Agency. And then another uncle was the head of the physics department at the University of Ottawa. And then another one was the head of the department of computer science at the University of Ottawa. And then another one was the head of the department of mathematics at the University of Ottawa. And then another one was the head of the department of economics at the University of Ottawa. It's like they just kept going up the ladder. And then my mom's brother married my dad's brother's wife. So they're like... I don't know, it's like we're like some sort of weird genetic experiment."," Well, I've always been interested in the future and in the limit, what an civilization looks like if it's successful and exists for a long time. And that is the definition of a civilization that I think we should strive for. A civilization that is long-lasting and where life on Earth is abundant and prosperous. And so I've been working on that for a long time. My first company was a software company called 'Zip2'. And the reason I started a software company was because I thought the internet was going to be important, and nobody in Silicon Valley seemed to think it was important. And I thought that was crazy, so I started a company to do software for the internet. And that company ended up doing very well. It got acquired by eBay. And then I used the money that I got from that to start SpaceX. And then I did an MBA at Stanford. And then I started Tesla. And so I've always been trying to push in that direction. And now we have Neuralink, which is really, I think, the most fundamental thing of all. Because an civilization that is long-lasting and where life on Earth is abundant and prosperous must be a civilization that is at least an order of magnitude smarter than we are. And so the point of Neuralink is to create a high bandwidth interface to the brain such that we can be symbiotic with A.I.  Because we have a bandwidth problem. You just can't communicate through your fingers. It's too slow.","{

We must get past this Fermi Great Filter of being a single-planet civilization.," I think we should really take the actions, the set of actions that are most likely to ensure the long-term survival of humanity. And we’re here on Earth, and Earth is great, but it’s not like the sort of ‘n’th’ planet from the sun. We’re actually on the first planet. So, if we don’t do things to ensure the long-term survival of humanity, I think eventually we’re just going to be like the proverbial one-planet civilization that dies out. And I think we want to be more than that. We want to be a multi-planet civilization and an spacefaring civilization and ultimately a space-faring civilization that is out there among the stars. And the things we do to ensure that we are a multi-planet species is the same thing that we need to do to ensure that we have a good future on Earth.
So, you know, if we expand the scope and scale of humanity and consciousness in general, which include silicon consciousness, that seems like a fundamentally good thing. And we want to make sure that the future is not controlled by a tiny group of people who happen to be lucky enough to be born in a certain place at a certain time. We want to make sure that the future is not theirs to control but that it’s the people’s future to control. And in order to do that, we must have a future that is not controlled by a tiny group of people who happen to be lucky enough to be born in a certain place at a certain time. We want to make sure that the future is not theirs to control but that it’s the people’s future to control. And in order to do that, we must have a future that is not limited to Earth."," I think we should be a multi-planet species and a spacefaring species and out there among the stars. I think this is very exciting and inspiring, and I think it’s very sad if Earth gets hit by a meteor or becomes a big red giant 500 million years from now and we don’t exist anymore. I think it’s very sad if we’re just like one of those lame one-planet civilizations that just dies out. I think it’s very exciting to be like, “Let’s be a multi-planet civilization and a spacefaring civilization and out there among the stars.” I think that’s like the most exciting thing that could happen to us.","{

Whereas, if you’re publishing a newspaper, let’s say, and there’s something in the newspaper that is false, you have to have a correction. But by the time that correction appears, a lot of people have already read the false article. With X, if something is false, we can correct it immediately. It’s real time.","{

"We have given a lot of attention to community notes, which corrects misinformation."," Well, we’ve improved the quality of the recommended tweets, so that’s helped a lot. And we’ve added content warnings, so if there’s something that might be potentially offensive, you’ll get a content warning. And we’ve added a lot of controls for community notes, so you can now control what appears in community notes. And we’ve added a lot of controls for what appears in the For You recommendations. So you can say, “I don’t want to see content from this account,” and you can mute keywords, phrases, entire topics. You can say, “I don’t want to see content that discusses this topic,” and it will actually, in the For You recommendations, prioritize content that you are likely to find relevant and interesting, and that’s based on how you’ve interacted with tweets in the past."," We’re not trying to be a sort of policing the misinformation. The aspiration for Twitter is to be the best source of truth that’s ever existed. And so, instead of trying to police misinformation, which is a sort of… You’re sort of playing whack-a-mole, because there’s a new form of misinformation that arises every day. The best approach is to simply be the best source of truth. And if something is not true, then the best source of truth will cause it to be defeated by the marketplace.
So, we’re not trying to be sort of the arbiter of what is truth. We’re trying to be the best source of truth. And we’re also trying to elevate the good journalists and bring them closer to the people. And we’re also trying to bring the people to the journalists, so that the journalists can actually hear what the people have to say. And we’re also adding a lot of context to what’s said on Twitter, so that if somebody is replying to something, that they will see all of the replies, and they’ll see all of the conversation around something, so that they can understand what everybody else is saying about a particular thing.
And we’re also adding a lot of functionality to communities. So, if something is a sort of a niche subject, you can still find the people who are interested in that niche subject. And you can then ask them questions. And you can also ask questions of the community. So, you can say, “I’m confused about this. Can you help me understand?” And then, the community can help you understand.","{

Free speech is meaningless unless you allow people you don’t like to say things you don’t like.," Well, I’m in favor of free speech, obviously, or I wouldn’t have a platform where people can say mean things to me.

It’s only a situation where people you like can say things you like. And that’s not free speech. It’s censorship."," Free speech is extremely important. It is only in the context of free speech that we can say that one thing is true and that another thing is false.

My goal is to create X the everything app.," Well, I think Twitter has a lot of potential. It’s a good source of truth, and I think it can be a force for good. I think it’s not kidding around when I say that if something is not done to address the long-form content, then the whole system will crumble. And we’ve seen this with the advertisers leaving the platform. This is not good. We need to move to a subscription model as soon as possible. I don’t know. I’m hoping we can do this by the end of the year. But that’s the only way. There’s no other way."," I think it’s a way to learn things, kind of stay in touch with what’s happening.

We have all time high usage.," Well, Twitter was doing very well before the acquisition and is doing very well after the acquisition. In fact, the acquisition was at a 44% premium to the market. The market was 16.4 billion, the acquisition was 24.8. So you can see that the market was undervaluing Twitter by a lot. And it’s now worth 130 billion. So it’s up by a factor of five since the acquisition. And we’ve added 100 million users. So the user growth is very strong. And we’ve done this despite the fact that the company was not given a loan that it was supposed to get, which was a very big deal. It was supposed to get a $1.5 billion loan, which was canceled at the last minute. So we did this in spite of that, which was a big deal."," Well, Twitter is now used by a large number of people in the United States and around the world to learn about current events. It’s also used to organize community events and to express yourself. It’s a way to communicate with others. It’s a way to amplify a voice. If somebody has something they want to say, it’s a way to amplify that voice. It’s also a way to learn about things that you’re interested in. If you’re interested in, say, dogs, you can learn a lot about dogs on Twitter.","{

We’ve added long form tweets and you can now post videos up to two hours.," Well, we’ve improved the algorithm, so it’s better at recommending tweets that you’ll find interesting. We’ve improved the system for reporting hateful conduct. We’ve improved the system for account suspension. We’ve improved the system for content moderation. We’ve added a number of new community notes features. Community Notes is really cool. It’s like Wikipedia for tweets. It allows the community to correct what’s said in a tweet.
So, for example, if somebody says something that is false, the community can then note that, provide evidence that what they said is false and effectively the note will then rank higher than the original tweet. We’ve also added paid verification, which is simply a way to reduce the number of impersonation accounts. Prior to paid verification, impersonation was extremely common. In fact, if you look at the impersonation attempts of, say, Elon Musk, there were many thousands per day.
Now, with paid verification, that’s dropped to basically zero. So I think it’s been quite effective. And we’ve also added a number of other features. We’ve improved the search functionality. We’ve improved the way that tweets are displayed. We’ve made it easier to see replies and to see what’s going on in a conversation. We’ve made it easier to see what’s going on in a community. We’ve made it easier to see what’s trending. We’ve improved the notifications system. We’ve made it so that you can edit tweets. We’ve added a number of other features, but those are some of the key ones."," We’ve made the video editing on Twitter much better, and we’ve also added a bunch of new video filters, and we’ve improved the quality of the video encoder. So overall, the videos look much better on Twitter, and the system can handle a lot more video. Previously, Twitter was constrained such that you could only watch a video if it was less than a certain length, or if it was a very short video, it would then be allowed to play. But now, any video of any length can play on Twitter.","{

Twitter should be a town square that gives equal voice to the whole country.," Well, my vision for Twitter is that it becomes the digital town square for the world. The digital town square is a concept that I think is very important because it’s where people from all over the world can come together and engage in meaningful dialogue. It’s important to have a common digital town square where people from all walks of life can come together and express their views and listen to the views of others.
And it’s also important that the digital town square be a place where people feel comfortable. So it’s important that the rules of the digital town square be fair and applied in a fair manner to all. And it’s also important that the digital town square be a place where people can learn.
I think there’s a lot that can be done to make Twitter a better learning platform. I think there’s a lot that can be done to make Twitter a better source of truth. And I think that Twitter can be a force for good in the world. And that’s my goal."," Well, I think we’re going to try to be as even-handed as possible. So we’re not trying to put a thumb on the scale monetarily or in any way. So I think we’re just trying to be as even-handed as possible. And like I said, the acid test is what do users think? And if users think that Twitter is a force for good, that it is a good source of truth, then they will stay on the platform and invite others to stay on the platform. And if they don’t, they will leave and they’ll take their friends and family with them. So I think the best source of truth is what users think. And we’re going to try to do our best to amplify the voice of the people.","{

I thought Twitter would perhaps accelerate progress versus creating something from scratch by 3 to 5 years.," Well, I tried to buy a platform from scratch. I tried to buy Snapchat. I tried to buy TikTok. None of those worked out. And then I sort of said, well, okay, we’re going to have to just sort of have a small army and build our own thing. And that’s what we started doing. And it’s going pretty well. It’s called “The Boring Company”. It’s doing very well. We’ve got a lot of projects.
But Twitter was really, frankly, I thought it was going to die. And I kind of wanted to have a dog, if it was going to die, to have a dog in the fight, you know. And so that’s why I bought Twitter. It’s not that I expected it to be a great financial success. In fact, I thought it was going to be a big loss. But I thought it was important for the country and for the people who use Twitter to have a dog in the fight, so to speak. And so that’s what I did."," Well, I thought the existing platform, even with all its issues, was actually quite good at getting things done. And I thought, well, there’s a lot of things that I would like to do that are not antithetical to Twitter. I think some of the things that I would like to do are actually very synergistic with Twitter. For example, adding payroll. I’m often asked, well, what’s the purpose of X in that regard. Well, one of the purposes of X is to provide a source of income for people, and a source of income for the company. And so having a payroll feature on Twitter, where you can get paid for doing things on Twitter, I think would be a great way to monetize.
It’s not like I’m strapped for cash or anything. But I think it would be a great way to monetize. It’s not some sort of a desperate move. I mean, it’s not a desperate move because I’m not desperate for money. But I think it would be a great way to monetize user activity. And generally, I’m just trying to think of what’s in the best interest of the users. And I think providing a way for people to get paid for their user activity on Twitter would be great.","{

Some things that we could do to make education more compelling would be to explain to children why we are teaching a particular subject. I also think that critical thinking is something that should be taught to children at a relatively young age.," Well, I think you really need to engage the children. You need to have active, not passive learning. You want to have things where they’re not just sitting in a classroom being lectured to, but that they’re actually doing things. They’re building things, they’re doing experiments, they’re working with their hands. You know, I think that’s very important. And you want to try to teach to the whole brain. Not just the cognitive brain but also the emotional brain and the physical brain. You know, you really want to get the body involved. You want to have physical activities, mental activities, emotional activities. And I think that’s really important.
And I think it’s also important to teach problem-solving or teach to the problem, not to the tools necessarily. You want to teach people how to solve problems, how to fix things. And I think a good way to do that is to have people take things apart and then they have to put them back together. Like if you want to teach people about engines, you should have people take an engine apart and then put it back together. And then they know what the engine does, why it does it, and how it works."," Well, I think first of all, you really need to fire the teachers that are bad. And I think there should be, like, if a teacher is not doing a good job, principally, they should fire them. And if they don’t fire them, then you should go to the school board and say, “Why aren’t you firing this teacher?” And I think we should have much higher standards for teachers. I think we should require that they get better grades in college, and that they get a degree in the subject that they’re teaching.
And I think we should have, like, if somebody’s going to be a teacher, I think they should have a mentor teacher that they work with, and they only get their full teacher certificate if their mentor teacher says that they should get it. And I think we should have, you know, like, if somebody’s a teacher, they should have to reapply for their job every year. And if they don’t reapply, then they lose their job. And I think we should rotate teachers around every few years so they don’t get complacent.
And I think we should have, you know, like, if somebody’s been a teacher for a while, and they haven’t been doing a good job, we should say, “Okay. You either go back to college and get some more training, or you’re fired.” I think we should be much more demanding of teachers, and principals, and school superintendents. And if they don’t shape up, they should lose their job.","{
